<blockquote>
  <p>“Today, “identity” feels a bit like a paradox, either celebrated as if it were entirely knowable and indisputable, or else the potential subject of an ambitious makeover. What hasn’t changed, I think, is the dodge: the fear that someone might see us for who we really are.”

  <p>Praying:</p>

  <p>It doesn’t have to be the blue iris,</p>

  <p>it could be weeds in a vacant lot, or a few small stones;</p>

  <p>just pay attention, then patch a few words together and don’t try</p>

  <p>to make them elaborate, this isn’t a contest but the doorway</p>

  <p>into thanks, and a silence in which another voice may speak.

  <p>“Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves. All people live in their own dream, in their own mind; they are in a completely different world from the one we live in. When we take something personally, we make the assumption that they know what is in our world, and we try to impose our world on their world.”

<blockquote>
  <p>We tend to measure performance by what happens when things are going well. Yet how people, organizations, companies, leaders, and other things do on their best day isn’t all that instructive.
To find the truth, we need to look at what happens on the worst day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some calculus tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics - and they are mostly clever fools - seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way. Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is that change doesn’t come without action. If you aren’t living the life you want, don’t expect to get any closer to it without taking action.
Without action you’re just relying on luck, and that likely won’t get you far. The day you decide to take ownership of your own life is going to be your luckiest day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In just a few short weeks on the job, I had already realized that because every tough decision came down to a probability, then certainty was an impossibility — which could leave me encumbered by the sense that I could never get it quite right. So rather than let myself get paralyzed in the quest for a perfect solution, or succumb to the temptation to just go with my gut every time, I created a sound decision-making process — one where I really listened to the experts, followed the facts, considered my goals and weighed all of that against my principles. Then, no matter how things turned out, I would at least know I had done my level best with the information in front of me.” - Obama</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The average person spends between 3–8 hours on the internet every day.
How much of that time is deliberate, purposeful, and goal-oriented?
When was the last time you got on the internet for a specific purpose, and then got off when that purpose was complete?</p>

  <p>The internet is more distracting and hard to evade than a Las Vegas casino.
When was the last time you had a full day where you ate exactly what you wanted, without impulsively grabbing something like sugar, carbs, or caffeine out of habit?</p>

  <p>These examples are only to show how unconsciously we generally live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/statuses/Dec2020/8.jpg" alt="8" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Have I done any good in the world today? Have I helped anyone in need? Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad? If not, I have failed indeed. There are chances for work all around just now, Opportunities right in our way. Do not let them pass by, saying, “Sometime I’ll try,” But go and do something today.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody wants IT immediately. But the world is an efficient place. Immediate doesn’t work. You have to put in the time. You have to put in the hours. You have to put yourself in that position with specific knowledge, accountability, leverage and an authentic skill-set in order to be the best in the world at what you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2020, we lived below our means.
Spent far lesser on travelling, eating out, buying random things, wasting our money on stuff that we thought we needed all along.
And we realized, it isn’t all that bad without it.
Life is not about stuff.</p>

  <p>We are truly rich when we know we don’t need the validation of external riches to feel rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?”
“You should not be satisfied with mere learning, but add practise and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should.” - Epictetus</p>

  <p>Don’t wait to better yourself. Start Now!</p>
