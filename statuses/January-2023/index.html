<blockquote>
  <p>There are a lot of things in life that only work when you commit.</p>

  <p>I don‚Äôt mean dabble. I don‚Äôt mean half-in. I mean commit.</p>

  <p>Commitment means all in, all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe trouble is that most people want to be right. The very best people, however, want to know if they‚Äôre right.‚Äù ‚Äî John Cleese</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choosing something once is easy. Choosing it repeatedly makes a difference.</p>

  <p>Ordinary choices compound into extraordinary results.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too much book learning may crab and confine the imagination, and endless poring over the research of others is sometimes psychologically a research substitute, much as reading romantic fiction may be a substitute for real-life romance‚Ä¶.The beginner must read, but intently and choosily and not too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost any problem is interesting if it is studied in sufficient depth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing is useful precisely because it‚Äôs difficult.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having too much free time is just as bad as being busy and stressed out. All that time tends to get filled with low-quality activities like internet browsing, binge-watching, and overthinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has an emotional blind spot when they fight. Work out what yours is, and remember it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If possible, take the stairs.</p>

  <p>If you‚Äôre going less than a mile, walk or cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The happiest people are givers, not the takers!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI think we have a lot of self-limiting beliefs. And the self-limiting beliefs, a lot of these come from inside us. Basically, I can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt do that. This is just the way I am. One of the most common problems is, this is just the way I am as if we have some ‚Äúreal‚Äù fixed identity that lives throughout time. And I have to really work on people to change that. Even smart people say things like this, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt listen. I can‚Äôt listen. I‚Äôve never been able to listen.‚Äù I‚Äôll look in their ears. ‚ÄúWhy not? You got something stuck in there? Why can‚Äôt you listen? Do you have an incurable genetic defect that is prohibiting you from listening?‚Äù As long as we tell ourselves, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way I am.‚Äù Two things happen, both bad. One, we inhibit the odds of ever getting better. Two, even if we do change our behavior we don‚Äôt seem authentic to ourselves. We feel like a phony because if the real me can‚Äôt listen and you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good listener. You know what I‚Äôm thinking?‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs not the real me. I‚Äôm just pretending to be a good listener because the real me is no good at that.‚Äù
‚ÄìMarshall Goldsmith</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAction is the antidote to despair.‚Äù - Joan Baez</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people read the same new books that everyone else has read, not necessarily for the ideas but for the social reward of being able to talk about them with others. Reading the same thing as everyone else is only going to put the same ideas in your head that everyone else has. If you want new ideas, read old books.</p>

  <p>Not just applicable for books.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It‚Äôs such a simple idea. It‚Äôs the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.‚Äù
‚ÄìCharlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good positions are expensive, but poor ones cost a fortune. Spend less time worrying about maximizing your immediate results and more time maximizing your ultimate results. Giving yourself options in the future always appears suboptimal in the moment. Putting yourself in a good position for tomorrow means paying today. This might mean a lower return, living below your means, or sitting on the sidelines when everyone else is having fun.</p>

  <p>Poor positioning kills more dreams than poor decisions. Decisions matter, but it‚Äôs easier to make good decisions when all your options are great.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Short-term easy is long-term hard. Short-term hard is long-term easy.</p>

  <p>The easy path today makes a hard path tomorrow. The hard path today makes an easier path tomorrow.</p>

  <p>The choice is yours, but the mountain isn‚Äôt going away. The longer you put off the hard thing you know you need to do, the harder it becomes to get started.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAll that is really worth the doing is what we do for others.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lewis Carroll</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The way to control is to let go of the control.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúYou are perfectly cast in your life. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone but you in the role. Go play.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lin-Manuel Miranda</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.</p>

  <p>The moment before letting go is often when we grip the hardest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn‚Äôt come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your mind doesn‚Äôt wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what‚Äôs in front of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot practice non-attachment. You can only show your mind the suffering that attachment creates. When it sees this clearly, it will let go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The growth mindset individual, will feel successful, worthy, and purposeful when they‚Äôre learning. What this essentially means is that failure, as a concrete idea or our general understanding of it, doesn‚Äôt really exist, because the harder a task or an undertaking is, the more we stand to grow as a result of doing it ‚Äî even if we don‚Äôt do it perfectly. With a growth mindset, we welcome challenge because instant success and recognition are not the ultimate goals.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, in the long run growth-minded people have the potential to go further, and grow bigger, in all aspects of their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guilt is in the past, and the one thing you cannot change is the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- 27 -->

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù
‚Äì Frankl</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you‚Äôve never thought about where you‚Äôd like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it when [insert perfect life conditions we mostly use as an excuse].‚Äù</p>

  <p>Do it now. Do it today. And keep it consistent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you‚Äôre only ever exposing yourself to interesting information, if you‚Äôre only ever exposing yourself to the stimuli, but not taking the time to actually think about it ‚Äî to process it, to look at it from different angles, to try to run it against other paradigms or structures you have in your current mental schema ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt do that work of just being alone with your own thoughts, you‚Äôre probably extracting just a small fraction of the potential value.</p>
