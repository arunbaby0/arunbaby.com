<meta name="description" content="The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.    His procedure was simple: on the final day of class, he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.    Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.">

<blockquote>
  <p>Meditation is not engaging in some pleasant or interesting experience in order to generate positive feelings. It’s not about tuning out the world and coming to a place of inner peace.</p>

  <p>True meditation is the ability to recognize what your mind is like, prior to being lost in thought. When you’re engaged in meditation, you’re no longer identifying with every thought, reaction, whim, or emotion that comes barreling into your mind.</p>

  <p>However, once you know how to practice, it is true to say that any activity can be synonymous with meditation. You can recognize the nature of your mind at any point, in any location, under any circumstance. But this must first be practised in formal sessions.</p>

  <p>So, yes. You can meditate while hiking, running, biking or doing anything else a human being can do. But only after you know how to practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all know people who behave very differently depending on who they’re around. Someone who’s polite, deferential, and accommodating with their grandmother can morph into a jerk when speaking with a customer service agent.</p>

  <p>Now, it’s easy to judge these people as being two-faced or disingenuous. But it’s instructive to notice that we’re all in this situation to varying degrees.</p>

  <p>For instance, who we are on a Zoom call with a client likely feels different than whom we are when speaking with a family member or friend.</p>

  <p>The core of whom we take ourselves to seem to remain intact, yet the face we wear seems to change, whether subtly or dramatically. It’s as if we have a collection of masks that we reflexively put on, depending on who’s in front of us.</p>

  <p>As you go about your day today, notice how your sense of self changes depending on whom you interact with. Notice the mask you’re wearing in each interaction.</p>

  <p>And realize that it’s not who you really are.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s something that looks way riskier than it actually is?</p>

  <p>Here’s my answer:
Asking. For anything!</p>

  <p>I would love to know your thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>If you tolerate too much half-heartedness, it’s probably because you’re half-hearted. As in: anxious and ambivalent, looking for reassurance. As in: bored, along for the ride, not really sure about your own feelings and opinions. As in: external locus of control vs internal locus of control. You probably don’t have anything in your life that really tethers you to yourself—you don’t have conviction about what you love, so you’re hoping that someone else will provide you that certainty.</p>

  <p>I think that people come alive when they’re serious about what they love—when they choose to pay careful attention to what feeds and sustains them.</p>
