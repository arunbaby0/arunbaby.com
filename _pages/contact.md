To avoid unnecessary headaches, I try to make clear how I communicate.

## General preferences
* I’m blunt and prefer straightforward communication.
* I hate small talks.

### Email
If we’ve never met before, the best way to reach me is via email. I check my inbox frequently and try to respond to every email.

#### Tips
* Short is sweet
* If there is a request that can be easly find online, do a detailed research before emailing.
* I procrastinate! If I haven’t responded after a week, feel free to follow up.


### Social media
I don't prefer social media for communication as I don’t spend a lot of time on it. 

Twitter: I’m not very active on Twitter.

Facebook: Quit in the begining of 2019.

Instagram: All I have is an account there. 

LinkedIn: I read LinkedIn messages but I prefer emails.

follow me on social media but reach me via email.

### Texting and calling
I use these for people who are close to me. So expect delays.

Watsapp: You can message me in watsapp. My response time is generally between 1 second and 7 days. 

My phone is always on silent so I will certainly miss unscheduled calls.

### Scheduling
I have a full-time job and when not working I do side projects.

If you are not a close person to me, follow the below guidelines:

"Lets meet at Cherai beach near parking station at 0630 IST" - is a plan. 

"Lets hangout this saturday" - is not a plan.

If there is an online meet, please send me a calender invite as i forget things easily.

## Conclusion
I just want to be systematic and reduce the overhead as much as possible. I am flexible with schedule changes, but pre-planning get rid of unnecessary delays.
