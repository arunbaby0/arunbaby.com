I'm always interested in meaningful conversations about AI, research, interesting projects, or just good ideas. Here's how to best reach me.

---

## Email (Preferred)

If we haven't connected before, email is the best way to reach me. I check regularly and respond to every thoughtful message.

**Email:** <em>**arunbaby0**</em> [@] Gmail

### A Few Tips for Better Conversations

- **Be direct**: Skip the formalities, get to the point. I appreciate clear, concise communication.
- **Do your homework**: If your question has an answer on Google or Stack Overflow, try that first. Come to me when you've hit a real wall.
- **Write like a human**: Donâ€™t talk like a press release. Talk like a person. A person is reading this, so why are you talking like that?
- **Follow up if needed**: I try to respond within a week, but sometimes things slip through. If I haven't replied, nudge me, I won't mind.

## Social Media

I'm on most platforms but don't spend much time there. Email will always get you a faster response.

- **LinkedIn**: I check messages occasionally, but email is better
- **Twitter/X**: Not very active
- **Instagram**: Mostly dormant
- **GitHub**: For code, issues, and pull requests

Feel free to follow or connect, but for actual conversations, email works best.

## Phone & Messaging

**WhatsApp**: You can reach me here, but response time varies wildly (anywhere from instant to... eventually). Best for quick questions or ongoing conversations.

**Calls**: My phone lives on silent mode. If we haven't scheduled a call, there's a good chance I'll miss it. For anything time-sensitive, schedule it in advance or send a message first.

## Scheduling Meetings

I run a startup and work on side projects, so time is precious. Here's what makes scheduling easier:

**Good:** "Let's meet at Starbucks on Main Street, Tuesday at 3 PM"  
**Not helpful:** "Let's catch up sometime next week"

For video calls, please send a calendar invite with:
- Clear agenda or topics to discuss
- Expected duration
- Meeting link

I'm flexible with schedule changes, just prefer having a concrete plan to start with.

## My Communication Style

A few things to know so we don't have awkward misunderstandings:

- **Direct, not rude**: I value honesty and efficiency over pleasantries. If I'm blunt, it's not personal, just how I communicate.
- **Substance over small talk**: Let's dive into the interesting stuff quickly.
- **Async-first**: I prefer written communication (email, docs) with scheduled calls when needed. This lets both of us think clearly.
- **Response time**: Usually within 48 hours for emails. Faster for urgent, well-defined matters.

## What I'm Always Open To

- Interesting technical problems in AI/ML/speech
- Research collaborations or discussions
- Project opportunities (see [Work With Me](/work-with-me/))
- Thoughtful questions from students and early-career engineers
- Random interesting conversations that don't fit any category

The best way to start? Just send an email. Tell me what's on your mind, what you're working on, or what you want to discuss. I'm pretty easy to reach, just make it clear, direct, and human.
