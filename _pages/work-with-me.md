I help teams build and ship intelligent conversational systems—from research prototypes to production-grade AI products. My expertise spans **Conversational AI**, **Speech Technologies**, and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on making complex ML systems actually work in the real world.

## What I Do

I work across the full ML lifecycle, from whiteboard to deployment:

- **Conversational AI**: Voice assistants, LLM-based agents, dialogue systems, context-aware bots
- **Speech Technologies**: ASR, TTS, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, voice biometrics  
- **ML Research & Engineering**: Custom models, research-to-production, fine-tuning, architectural design
- **Production ML Systems**: Scalable deployment, optimization, monitoring, and iteration

Whether you're exploring a new research direction or need to ship a production system, I bridge the gap between what's possible and what's practical.

## Full-Time Roles

I'm open to full-time opportunities in conversational AI, speech, and ML engineering—particularly roles that combine research thinking with product delivery.

### Start With a Trial Period

For remote positions, I offer a flexible trial structure (especially valuable for US/European companies):

- **1-3 month part-time engagement** (10-30 hours/week)
- Work together on real projects before committing
- Validate technical fit, communication, and work style
- Convert to full-time when we're both confident it's the right fit

This de-risks international hires and ensures we're aligned before making long-term commitments.

### Direct Full-Time

If you need someone to start immediately or prefer a traditional hire, I'm open to that too. For on-site roles, I'm willing to relocate.

### Let's Talk

**Email:** <em>**hire**</em> [@] arunbaby [dot] com  
**Subject:** [Full-Time] or [Trial-to-Hire]

Share details about the role, your team, and what you're building. Include:
- What you're working on (JD, product demo, or deck)
- Team structure and who I'd work with
- Tech stack and current challenges
- Timeline and location/remote setup

I respond to all inquiries within 48 hours.

## Project-Based Work

I work with companies on focused ML/AI projects—typically 2-6 month engagements at 20-30 hours/week.

### Types of Projects

**Research & Prototyping**
- Feasibility studies and proof-of-concepts
- Novel approaches to hard problems
- Algorithm development and experimentation

**Applied AI Development**  
- Custom model development and fine-tuning
- LLM/speech model integration and optimization
- End-to-end pipeline design

**ML Engineering**
- Production system architecture
- Model deployment and monitoring
- Performance optimization and scaling

**Strategic Advisory**
- ML roadmap and architecture reviews  
- Technical due diligence
- Team guidance and technical leadership

### How We'll Work Together

1. **Discovery call** - Understand your goals, constraints, timeline
2. **Scope & proposal** - Clear deliverables, milestones, timeline
3. **Iterative delivery** - Regular check-ins, working prototypes, clear communication
4. **Knowledge transfer** - Documentation, code walkthroughs, team enablement

I prioritize clear communication, pragmatic solutions, and making sure your team can maintain what we build.

### Start a Conversation

**Email:** <em>**hire**</em> [@] arunbaby [dot] com  
**Subject:** [Project Inquiry]

Tell me about what you're trying to build:
- Problem you're solving and current state
- What success looks like
- Timeline and budget expectations
- Technical constraints or requirements

Don't worry about having everything figured out—we can scope it together.

## Research Collaboration

I enjoy working with other researchers on interesting problems in conversational AI, speech, and ML. Open to both academic and industry research partnerships.

**What I'm interested in:**
- Co-authoring papers on speech/NLP/conversational AI
- Joint experiments and shared datasets
- Technical content creation (blogs, talks, tutorials)
- Open-source projects with research impact

**Email:** <em>**hire**</em> [@] arunbaby [dot] com  
**Subject:** [Research Collab]

Share what you're working on and how you think we might collaborate. I'm always up for interesting technical conversations.

## Mentorship

If you're a student or early-career engineer working on ML/AI problems, I'm happy to help where I can.

**A few guidelines:**
- Do your research first—most issues have solutions online
- Send one detailed email with context rather than multiple short ones  
- Show what you've tried so far

**Email:** <em>**hire**</em> [@] arunbaby [dot] com  
**Subject:** [Mentorship]

## Working With Me

A few things that might be helpful to know:

- **Communication**: I'm responsive and prefer async communication (email, docs) with regular sync check-ins
- **Timezone**: Flexible—I've worked with teams across US, Europe, and Asia
- **Work style**: I focus on pragmatic solutions, clear documentation, and knowledge sharing
- **Philosophy**: Ship working prototypes fast, iterate based on real data, avoid over-engineering

I believe the best work happens when there's clear communication, mutual respect, and shared ownership of outcomes.

*Questions? Just email. The faster way to figure out if we're a good fit is to start a conversation.*
