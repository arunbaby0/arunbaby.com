A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms problems, from fundamentals to advanced topics. Each problem explores multiple solutions, complexity analysis, and real-world applications.

Each problem includes:
- Multiple approaches (brute force → optimal)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Production engineering considerations
- Connections to machine learning systems
- Code examples and edge cases
