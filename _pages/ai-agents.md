A comprehensive collection exploring AI agents—autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act. From foundational concepts to production deployment, covering voice agents, vision agents, multi-agent systems, and cutting-edge research.

Each topic includes:
- Core concepts and architecture patterns
- Implementation approaches (tool-agnostic)
- Production engineering considerations  
- Code examples and best practices
- Connections to LLMs, RAG, and multimodal AI
