Just a random guy who try to remove biases and get rid of labels from life. On a journey to becoming unlabelable. OMG, is that another label!!!

I started writing here just to improve my writing skills. There may be many mistakes here. Do not take any opinions expressed here personally. I would always love to discuss if you hold a different opinion. A debate is not my cup of tea. I would rather be your mental sparring partner, so we both can learn.

The blog posts that you see here are just random dumping of my thoughts. The ideas you read here may not be original; Mostly borrowed from others shamelessly. Feel free to copy anything from here and keep the idea as your own.

I am currently with [Zapr Media Labs](https://www.zapr.in/) as a Research Scientist(AI and ML), developing an end-to-end solution for [Conversational AI](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+conversational+AI).

I had worked at [CISCO](https://www.cisco.com/), [Speech and Music Tech lab(IIT Madras)](https://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/tts/), [Qbotics Labs](https://qboticslabs.com/) and [HCL technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/).


I have a Masters degree in Computer science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). 

I am active in sports(Volleyball, Squash, Badminton, Table tennis...), and had trained in martial arts ([Hapkido](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/~murgi/hapkido/), MMA, Muay Thai..).

I am an avid reader(will start posting book reviews soon :P). Also, I try to follow minimalism as much as possible.

I do listen to podcasts. The list of people I follow can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link  _pages/podcasts-I-listen-to.md %} ).

Iâ€™m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me. [Click here to see the contact details.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link  _pages/contact.md %})
