Just a random guy who try to remove biases and get rid of labels from life. On a journey to becoming unlabelable. OMG, is that another label!!!

I started writing here just to improve my writting skills. There may be many mistakes here. Do not take any opinions expressed here personally. I would always love to have a discussion, if you hold a different opinion. Debate is not my cup of tea. I would rather avoid that game.
