I started writing here just to improve my writting skills. There may be many mistakes here. Do not take any opinions expressed here personally. I would always love to have a discussion, if you hold a different opinion. Debate is not my cup of tea. I would rather avoid that game.

The blog post that you here are just random dumping of my thoughts. The ideas you read here may not be original; Mostly borrowed from others. Feel free to copy anything from here and keep the idea as your own.
