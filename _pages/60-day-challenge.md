## Why This Matters

### Learning Philosophy

This structured approach emphasizes:
- **Fundamentals First:** Strong foundation in algorithms and data structures
- **System Thinking:** Understanding how concepts scale in production
- **Depth & Breadth:** Deep expertise in speech tech, broad ML knowledge
- **Practical Application:** Real-world engineering trade-offs

### Thematic Connections

Each day's problems are thematically linked to reinforce concepts:

**Example - Day 1:**
- **DSA (Two Sum):** Hash table for O(1) lookup ‚Üí Feature stores
- **ML System (Recommendations):** Fast embedding lookup, caching strategies
- **Speech (ASR):** Low-latency inference, state management

This approach builds **systems thinking** - connecting theory to practice.
