It is the acceptance of our limited knowledge.</p>

<p>Does our culture encourage us to practise this? Not knowing is mostly associated with ignorance for most people.</p>

<p>Why is it difficult for us to see the limitations of our perspective? Is it difficult for a fish to see water?</p>

<p>There can have no argument between two people who says “I don’t know”, It will only be a discussion.</p>

<p>Does acknowledging our limited knowledge make us any inferior person?  Once you admit to not knowing, your knowledge will have much greater value.</p>

<p>Once we accept the fact that we don’t know, the real possibility of exploration starts. Anything is possible once we follow our curiosity.</p>

<p>Do we need to know everything in the entire cosmos? Not really, I think. We hardly need to know anything.</p>

<p>Do I know the answers to the above questions at least? well, I DON’T.</p>]]></content><author><name>Arun Baby</name></author><category term="thoughts" /><category term="difficult" /><category term="dont" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“I don’t know”.

Many people try to win every game. But at what cost, what was the point of winning?</p>

<p>We are all playing one game or the other 24x7. Are we conscious of the games that we are playing?</p>

<p>We define the rules sometimes for the games; Some time its others. Sometimes we play the games we know we can’t win.</p>

<p>Sometimes we try to modify the rules of the game while we are playing, to increase the odds of our winning. what greatness is there in that kind of wins. You could have chosen the right game to play in the first place.</p>

<p>In some games, both parties can win. This increases the odds of having a good relationship with the other players.
In some, we have to trash others to win the game. This often ends up in toxic relationships.</p>

<p>Many games are played in the mind initially. Why are we even obsessed with winning the game, if we don’t care about the outcomes?</p>

<p>The best strategy to win at some of the games is just by not playing it. 
Our economy thrives on selling our attention to advertisers. When a battalion of scientists fights for our attention, by all means, the best strategy to win that game is not by playing it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Arun Baby</name></author><category term="thoughts" /><category term="winning" /><category term="game" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What does it mean to win a game?

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. - Bruce lee</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The eastern philosophy is about resistance to growth, whether it is physical or mental. It is freedom from the resistance that’s built by ourself. In soft martial arts, we don’t suppress the blow from the opponent using any force, we just work around it and direct it back to the person.</p>

<p>When the focus is on the aspects of how things should have been, or the way someone treated us, when we rely on the perceived norms of society, when we cannot accept things as they are, we are being resistant.</p>

<p>It is similar to the idea of getting identified with labels. You are resisting the growth once you start identifying with labels.</p>

<p>How can we practise non-resistance? What barriers that we have already created in our minds?

How can we disentangle these two?</p>

<p>We often have some hard feeling towards someone because of the perspective of that person, but we equate the person to the perspective. They might have expressed something, which irritated you, because of their particular perspective.</p>

<p>A person’s perspective is not permanent. It changes for many reasons.
It would be very easy to understand people once we understand this concept. Trying to understand the person’s perspective often opens the door to strengthen the relationship.</p>

<p>How do you separate the person from the perspective? Whenever you try to judge someone, take a pause and think why that person is thinking that way?
This is applicable for ourself as well. Think about why we are thinking what we think to open the door to a different level of understanding.</p>
