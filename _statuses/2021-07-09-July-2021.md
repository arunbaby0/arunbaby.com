>The best way to improve your ability to think is to spend time thinking. Most of us are too busy to think. We have too many meetings. Too many calls. Too many priorities. Too many demands on our time. With no time to think and make good decisions we rush and make bad ones. 
>
>And because we made bad decisions, our precious time is further strained as we correct our previous decisions.


>If you choose not to react because you value your inner peace a lot more than winning an argument,
>
>it's called wisdom and not lack of confidence.


>Not everyone who tells you that you are wrong, are people you should avoid.
>
>There are people who tell you that you are wrong.
There are people that help you see where you are wrong.
>
>The latter are precious. Hunt for them. Embrace them.
They are the ones we all need.
>
>Reach out to someone who has played that role in your life.


>A huge step in life is when you start questioning things. We are taught so many things that are untrue. The next step is becoming able to reject lies and live in a more honest way. The hardest part is when you do that well, you find yourself very alone because so few people challenge the illusion. It’s not easy to walk that path, but evolution requires hard work.

>All you can do is live the best you know how. Maybe that can help other people... Either way, I believe everyone has to find the next step forward in their own way. I don’t think anyone can do it for you. But it does help to have examples.


>“You can’t outrun your pain. You are strong enough to face whatever is in front of you. Medicating your pain will only bring more pain. The only genuine shortcut life offers is facing your feelings. They won’t kill you. Feelings are your soul’s way of communicating. Pain is trying to teach you something, and if you don’t listen now, it will speak louder and louder until it is heard."
— Jewel in Never Broken


>The cost of making decisions to please others instead of yourself is misery.


>Vegetarian Lion: “Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you’re a good person is like expecting a lion not to attack you because you’re a vegetarian.”
>
>Mighty Mosquito: “If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.” — the Dalai Lama

>Checkmate Pigeons: “Don’t play chess with a pigeon. It’ll just knock over the pieces, shit all over the board and then strut around like it won the game.”


>Apple Exchange: “If I have an apple and you have an apple and we exchange them, we both still have one apple. However, if I have an idea and you also have an idea and we exchange them, we both have two ideas.”
>
>“Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. So, switch off the pulsating TV/radio/online news, you will feel better.”


>“If someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom. Yet, how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you. When you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master.” -Epictetus.
