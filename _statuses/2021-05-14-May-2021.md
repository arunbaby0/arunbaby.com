>When you care more about getting things right than being right, you get better outcomes and you save time and energy.


>“A year from now you will wish you had started today.”
>— Karen Lamb


>In reality, addiction can form to just about anything. We attach moral reasoning to it after the fact. The key to solving addiction is to remove stigma and shame, not drown people in it.
>
>People like to use their moral reasoning in order to inflict pain and suffering on everyone else. They see it as imperative to impose their own beliefs on others.
They think by cleansing the world, then they’ll cleanse themselves.
>
>Instead of focusing on their own actions and behaviours, they identify the root cause in something outside themselves — an exterior enemy that has to be eradicated in order for them to feel wholesome. They project this hate toward anyone who’s not like them. 
>
>In reality, they love sin.
>
>They hate the sinner.


>The fastest learners are young children because they don’t care what other people think about them. When they fall, they pull themselves right back up – hundreds of times – because they want to walk and don’t care who is watching them fall in the process. As we grow older, we are not only ashamed when we fall, we are afraid before we even try something new that someone will criticize us.
>
>Learning is a lifelong process as we fall and pull ourselves up, sometimes hundreds of times. But like children who are determined to walk, we can keep uncovering the limiting beliefs that block us from moving forward and change them, one truth and one step at a time.


>"The more I know - the more I know that I don't know." - Richard Feynman


>Being bored takes courage. 
>
>Most of us would rather occupy ourselves with our phone, a book, or even the back of a cereal box rather than sit still with no distractions. But this reluctance to be alone with ourselves comes at a cost. 
>
>It means we may never discover what boredom actually is: a diving board into the deep end of our mind—and a gateway to something bigger and more profound. 
>
>The truth is, there are many astonishing insights waiting for us on the other side of boredom. But to access these insights, we first need to set aside our comforting distractions, if only for a moment at a time.


>Being busy isn't the same thing as adding value.


> “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work."
— H. L. Hunt


>"If we see someone throwing money away, we call that person crazy. Money has value. Wasting it seems nuts. And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time."
>
>— The Shortness of Time 


>“The flaws you see in others are actually a reflection of yourself.”
— Eve Branson
>
>Coming to terms with this requires you to drop your ego and be humble, but when you do, you can get to the root of the trouble and start working on yourself.


>“What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” — George Eliot


>You see the world through your perspective, just as everyone else views it through theirs. 
>
>People often form assumptions about others’ behaviour based on their own. If they don’t trust others, chances are it’s because they know others can’t trust them.
