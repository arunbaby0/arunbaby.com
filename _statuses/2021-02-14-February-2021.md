>“If you ever want to have peace in your life, you have to move beyond good and evil.”
>
>“Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.”



>“Real happiness only comes as a side-effect of peace. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment.”


>“Tension is who you think you should be.
Relaxation is who you are.”
—Buddhist saying



>Doctors won’t make you healthy.
Nutritionists won’t make you slim.
Teachers won’t make you smart.
Gurus won’t make you calm.
Mentors won’t make you rich.
Trainers won’t make you fit.
>
>Ultimately, you have to take responsibility.
>Save yourself.



>When everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease.


>“The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.”


>“You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you’re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future.”


>“Impatience with actions, patience with results.”
>
>When you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don’t really want to change—we don’t want to go through the pain just yet. 
>
>At least recognize it, be aware of it, and give yourself a smaller change you can actually carry out.



>“Don’t spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you’re happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy. ”
>
>“If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it’s your problem. But, if they have an expectation of you, that’s completely their problem. It has nothing to do with you. They’re going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you can dash their expectations, the better. ”


>People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.


>The modern struggle:
>
>Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising…
>
>Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs.


>How to be wrong a lot less often? Know the other side of the argument better than they do.
>
>I’m not entitled to have an opinion on any subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think that only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.



>Self-serving bias; you want to get that out of yourself; thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self.
