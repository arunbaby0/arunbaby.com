## Abstract: 
<em>The perceptual quality of neural text-to-speech (TTS) is highly dependent on the choice of the model during training. Selecting the model using a training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text. All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the proposed model selection method is language independent.</em>
