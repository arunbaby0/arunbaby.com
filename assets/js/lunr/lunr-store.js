Importance of language corpora is recognized since long before in many countries. The amount of work in speech domain for Indian languages is comparatively lower than that of other languages. This demands the speech corpus for Indian languages. The corpus presented here is a database of speech audio files and corresponding text transcriptions. Various criteria are addressed while building the database for these languages namely, optimal text selection, speaker selection, pronunciation variation, recording specification, text correction for handling out-of-the-vocabulary words and so on. Furthermore, various characteristics that affect speech synthesis quality like encoding, sampling rate, channel, etc is considered so that the collected data will be of high quality with defined standards. Database and text to speech synthesizers are built for all the 13 languages, namely, Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Odiya, Rajasthani, Tamil and Telugu.

Murthy   Abstract:  This paper describes the design of a language independent parser for text-to-speech synthesis in Indian languages. Indian languages come from 5–6 different language families of the world. Most Indian languages have their own scripts. This makes parsing for text to speech systems for Indian languages a difficult task. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. Most importantly Indian languages are more or less phonetic and can be considered to consist broadly of about 35–38 consonants and 15–18 vowels. In this paper, an attempt is made to unify the languages based on this broad list of phones. A common label set is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. A uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of Indian languages. The proposed parser converts UTF-8 text to common label set, applies letter-to-sound rules and generates the corresponding phoneme sequences. The parser is tested against the custom-built parsers for multiple Indian languages. The TTS results show that the accuracy of the phoneme sequences generated by the proposed parser is more accurate than that of language specific parsers.

Beyond the communication aids for the visually impaired and vocally handicap, TTS voices are being used in various educational, telecommunication and multimedia applications. All around the world people are trying to build TTS voice for their regional languages. TTS voice building requires a number of steps to follow and involves use of multiple tools, which makes it time consuming, tedious and perplexing to a user. This paper describes a Toolkit developed for HMM-based TTS voice building that makes the process much easier and handy. The toolkit uses all required tools, viz. HTS, Festival, Festvox, Hybrid Segmentation Tool, etc. and handles each and every step starting from phone set creation, then prompt generation, hybrid segmentation, F0 range finding, voice building, and finally putting the built voice into Synthesis framework.

The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. In an earlier work, we had proposed the use of signal processing cues in tandem with GMM-HMM based forced alignment for boundary correction for building Indian language TTS systems. In this paper, we capitalise on the ability of robust acoustic modeling techniques such as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) for acoustic modeling. The GMM-HMM based forced alignment is replaced by DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM based forced alignment. Signal processing cues are used to correct the segment boundaries obtained using DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM segmentation. TTS systems built using these boundaries show a relative improvement in synthesis quality.   Cite:  @inproceedings{Baby2017,   author={Arun Baby and Jeena J. Prakash and Rupak Vignesh and Hema A.

There are two tasks that are crucial for building TTS systems, namely, parsing, and labeling.    Although Indian languages are more or less phonetic, parsing especially the issue of schwa deletion must be addressed carefully.   Accurate labeling of speech at the subword level is another important task. Owing to the nonavailability of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems in Indian languages, accurate labeling at the subword level is a difficult task.

Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manually (listening and marking), when digital resources are scarce. Manually labeling of data can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phonemes can be as short as 10ms. The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is, to perform forced alignment using monophone HMM models that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in a DNN/CNN framework to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues are used. The final waveforms are then used in an HMM based statistical parametric synthesis framework to build speech synthesis systems for 5 Indian languages. Qualitative assessments indicate that there is a significant improvement in quality of synthesis.   Cite:  NA   Links:   PDF   Code:  NA  ","categories": ["publications"],

Acoustic models are likely to be accurate provided the phone boundaries are determined accurately. Conventional flat-start based Viterbi phone alignment (where only utterance level transcriptions are available) results in poor phone boundaries as the boundaries are not explicitly modeled in any statistical machine learning system. The focus of the effort in this paper is to explicitly model phrase boundaries using acoustic cues obtained using signal processing. A phrase is made up of a sequence of words, where each word is made up of a sequence of syllables. Syllable boundaries are detected using signal processing. The waveform corresponding to an utterance is spliced at phrase boundaries when it matches a syllable boundary. Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) training is performed phrase by phrase, rather than utterance by utterance. Training using these short phrases yields better acoustic models. This alignment is then fed to a DNN to enable better discrimination between phones. During the training process, the syllable boundaries (obtained using signal processing) are restored in every iteration. A relative improvement is observed in WER over the baseline Indian languages, namely, Gujarati, Tamil, and Telugu.

        "excerpt":"[Conference] INTERSPEECH 2018, Hyderabad, India, September 2018   Authors:  Anju Leela Thomas, Anusha Prakash, Arun Baby, Hema Murthy   Abstract:  Most Indians are inherently bilingual or multilingual owing to the diverse linguistic culture in India. As a result, code-switching is quite common in conversational speech. The objective of this work is to train good quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers that can seamlessly handle code-switching. To achieve this, bilingual TTSes that are capable of handling phonotactic variations across languages are trained using combinations of monolingual data in a unified framework. In addition to segmenting Indic speech data using signal processing cues in tandem with hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN), we propose to segment Indian English data using the same approach after NIST syllabification. Then, bilingual HTS-STRAIGHT based systems are trained by randomizing the order of data so that the systematic interactions between the two languages are captured better. Experiments are conducted by considering three language pairs: Hindi+English, Tamil+English and Hindi+Tamil. The code-switched systems are evaluated on monolingual, code-mixed and code-switched texts. Degradation mean opinion score (DMOS) for monolingual sentences shows marginal degradation over that of an equivalent monolingual TTS system, while the DMOS for bilingual sentences is significantly better than that of the corresponding monolingual TTS systems.

        "excerpt":"[MS Thesis] IIT Madras: February 2019; Supervised by Prof. Hema A Murthy   Authors:  Arun Baby   Abstract:  India is a country with 22 official languages (written in 13 different scripts), 122 major languages and 1599 other languages.  These languages come from 5-6 different language families of the world.  It is only about 65% of this population that is literate, that too primarily in the vernacular.  Speech interfaces, especially in the vernacular, are enablers in such an environment.  Building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for such a diverse country necessitates a unified approach.  This research work aims to build Indian language TTS systems in a unified manner by exploiting the similarities that exist among these languages. Specifically, the focus is on two components of the TTS system, namely, text parsing and speech segmentation.   Parsing is the process of mapping graphemes to phonemes.  Indian languages are more or less phonetic and have about 35-38 consonants and 15-18 vowels. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. A Common Label Set (CLS) is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. In this work, a uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of these languages.   Segmentation is the process of finding phoneme boundaries in a speech utterance. The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. State-of-the-art  speech segmentation approach for speech segmentation in Indian languages is hybrid segmentation which uses signal processing cues along with GMM-HMM framework. Deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are known for robust acoustic modelling. In this work, signal processing cues, that are agnostic to speaker and language, are used in tandem with deep learning techniques to improve the phonetic segmentation.

Selecting the model using a training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text. All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the proposed model selection method is language independent.

        "excerpt":"[Journal] Speech Communication: Volume 123, October 2020, Pages 10-25   Authors:  Arun Baby, Jeena J.Prakash, Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian, Hema A.Murthy   Abstract:  Building speech synthesis systems for Indian languages is challenging owing to the fact that digital resources for these languages are hardly available. Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manual (listening and marking) when digital resources are scarce. But the manual labeling of speech data (also known as speech segmentation) can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phones can be as short as 10ms.   The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is to perform forced alignment using monophone hidden Markov models (HMMs) that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in neural network frameworks to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis/recognition. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues like short-term energy (STE) and sub-band spectral flux (SBSF) are used in tandem with HMM based forced alignment for automatic speech segmentation.   STE and SBSF are computed on the speech waveforms. STE yields syllable boundaries, while SBSF provides locations of significant change in spectral flux that are indicative of fricatives, affricates, and nasals. STE and SBSF cannot be used directly to segment an utterance. Minimum phase group delay based smoothing is performed to preserve these landmarks, while at the same time reducing the local fluctuations. The boundaries obtained with HMMs are corrected at the syllable level, wherever it is known that the syllable boundaries are correct. Embedded re-estimation of monophone HMM models is again performed using the corrected alignment. Thus, using signal processing cues and HMM re-estimation in tandem, robust monophone HMM models are built. These models are then used in Gaussian mixture model (GMM), deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks to obtain state-level frame posteriors. The boundaries are again iteratively corrected and re-estimated.   Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built for different Indian languages using phone alignments obtained with and without the use of signal processing based boundary corrections. Unit selection based and statistical parametric based TTS systems are built. The result of the listening tests showed a significant improvement in the quality of synthesis with the use of signal processing based boundary correction.

The villagers lament his misfortune, and he replies “We’ll see.” The horse returns with four more horses, and the farmer is praised for his good luck. He replies, “We’ll see.” His son then attempts to break the horses, and breaks his leg. Again, the villagers console him for his bad luck. The reply again is “We’ll see.” Then the army comes and conscripts all the able-bodied young men, but the farmer’s son is spared. — Michael Sachse          The only real shortcut in life is to understand it backwards.

If you find you’re breathing but not living, it’s not time you need, but love.          “A child can teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.” — Paulo Coelho       “One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don’t seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don’t. Most people don’t even reach the stage of making something they’re embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They’re too frightened even to start.” —Early Work by Paul Graham          The right thing to do is often obvious. It’s not the choice that’s difficult so much as dealing with what the choice means. We have to have a hard conversation. We have to break someone’s heart. We have to do something hard. We have to break out of the prison of how other people think we should live. The price of avoiding these things is making yourself miserable. While the pain of dealing with reality is intense, it’s over rather quickly. The suffering of miserableness never really goes away. The choice of being miserable is the bargain you strike with yourself to avoid pain.

Instagram turns me covetous. All of them make me want to do it—whatever “it” may be—for the likes, the comments.

It’s hard to be a conformist if you don’t know what you’re supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out. It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you’re surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.  – Paul graham  link   ","categories": ["statuses"],

And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.          Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature.  It’s cheap to experiment with these.       You have vanishingly little political influence and every thought you spend on politics will probably come to nothing.  Consider building things instead, or at least going for a walk.       Liking and wanting things are different.  There are things like junk food that you want beyond enjoyment. But you can also like things (like reading) without wanting them.  If you remember enjoying something but don’t feel a desire for it now, try pushing yourself.       Bad things happen dramatically (a pandemic). Good things happen gradually (malaria deaths dropping annually) and don’t feel like ‘news’.  Endeavour to keep track of the good things to avoid an inaccurate and dismal view of the world.

Other people being happy is their problem. It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you’re happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy. ”     “If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it’s your problem. But, if they have an expectation of you, that’s completely their problem. It has nothing to do with you. They’re going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you can dash their expectations, the better. ”       People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.       The modern struggle:     Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising…     Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs.       How to be wrong a lot less often? Know the other side of the argument better than they do.     I’m not entitled to have an opinion on any subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think that only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.       Self-serving bias; you want to get that out of yourself; thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self.          “Just because you like it does not mean that the world will necessarily give it to you.”       “Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.” “Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”       “In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.” ― Mortimer J. Adler       If we are always glued to our phones, even when going to the bathroom, then we can’t tolerate even 5 min of boredom. And if so, how will we do worthwhile things in life?     To do anything meaningful, we have to be willing to slog and make peace with boredom. Good doctors undergo years of mind-numbing studies. Glamorous sounding jobs like consulting and banking can be murderously tedious. To do breakthrough research, scientists read through reams of research papers, filled with dense math, jargon, and technical details.       To do worthwhile things, we have to overcome our addiction to constant excitement. Once in a while, let us do nothing for some time - embrace boredom, and be with our thoughts.     We are always busy connecting with others. Today, why not try connecting with yourself?       It’s too much work to change our minds. It’s too much work to dance with the fear of failure. It’s too much work to imagine walking through the world differently.     That doesn’t have to be the case. We can refuse to be brainwashed into accepting the status quo, and we can commit to finding the others, engaging with them and leveling up.     If we care enough.       Walking for 10 km carrying a heavy bag is misery. But when we call it hiking, we love it.     The experience is the same - it is neither good nor bad. It is what our mind makes it to be.     More often than not, the misery, as well as the happiness we experience, is manufactured by our mind.       Addiction is the inability to control our urge for something we know is harmful and which leaves us dissatisfied after its use. The more we use it, the more desensitized we become and need higher doses to get the same high.     Does it ring a bell?       Those who know themselves and maximize their strengths are the ones who go where they want to go.     Those who don’t know themselves, and avoid the hard work of looking inward, live life by default. They lack the ability to create for themselves their own future.       It is better to be lost and busy in the chase of finding yourself, instead of being lost and busy in the rat race of never knowing yourself.       Wherever you are in life, and based on who is around you, and based on your current aspirations, those are the things that shape your beliefs.     Nobody explains, though, that “beliefs” then are not “fixed.” There is no “right and wrong.” It is all relative.     Find what works for you.       The average person spends 2 hours and 24 minutes every day checking social media. (This can further affect happiness because there’s an association between screen time and depression.) Yet people often wish they had more time to travel, read, exercise, learn a language, spend time with loved ones, etc. — all of which can help boost joy, fulfilment, and positivity.     link     Something doesn’t add up. Cut out all social media and news consumption for two weeks and see what happens.     What will you do with your extra two hours each day?       Growing up is the realization that you are both the sculpture and the sculptor, the painter and the portrait.     Paint yourself however you wish.       “It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.” — Bruce Lee       Ultimately, if you can’t be happy without those things, then you can’t be happy with them.     That’s not to say you should never try to achieve anything in life. Instead, try to reach goals without making happiness depend on them — in other words, without attaching happiness to them. It creates far more freedom, ease, and peace.     And if you ever happened to lose what you had, you won’t be as devastated because it was never the source of your happiness in the first place.

        "excerpt":"   “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body, ”- Richard Steele.       Choose your role models carefully.     Those with the loudest voices rarely offer the wisest insights.     The best advice often is to just “find someone who has what you want, and ignore the rest.”       “I wonder what it is that the more we have, the more we become prisoners at the thought of losing it, rather than setting us free.”       There’s no quicker path to misery than conditional happiness.     When the high dissipates, we seek the next one, finding happiness only when we achieve a goal; everything in between is just filler.     If you can’t find happiness during the pursuit, it won’t last long when you reach the finish line. Find joy in the journey, and if it eludes you, reassess your mission.          It’s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.     The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.     link       Memory is an intrinsic part of our life experience. It is critical for learning, and without memories we would have no sense of self.     Understanding why some memories stick better than others, as well as accepting their fluidity, helps us reduce conflict and better appreciate just how much our memories impact our lives.       “Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.” — Lao Tzu       Often injustice lies in what you aren’t doing, not only in what you are doing.       “The student as a boxer, not a fencer.” Why?     Because the fencer has a weapon they must pick up. A boxer’s weapons are a part of him, he and the weapon are one.     Same goes for knowledge, philosophy and wisdom.       It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.          Kindness isn’t always easy or obvious, because the urgent race to the bottom, to easily measured metrics and to scarcity, can distract us. But bending the arc toward justice, toward dignity and toward connection is our best way forward.     Kindness multiplies and it enables possibility. When we’re of service to people, we have the chance to make things better.       “The wise man knows exactly what value should be put upon everything.” — Seneca       “The best way to avenge yourself is to not be like that.”       It is easy to connect over mutual dislike, but it is a toxic practice.     Work on talking about books, or ideas, or travel, or anything else you find even mildly interesting.       I think it’s fair to assert that sometimes, our moods are handed to us.     But it’s also clearly true that we can do things to improve our mood. Morning pages, meditation, exercise, positive thinking, the right audio inputs, who we hang out with, the media we consume–it’s all a choice.     And if it’s a choice, that means it’s a skill, because we can get better at it.       What was true 5 years ago may not be true now, and yet, both were true for you at some point in time.     Embracing the paradoxes of life — that often, conflicting ideas can both be true in their own ways — will save you a lot of stress.       “The dangers of prolonged sitting in an earlier study that showed that, compared with sitting for under 6.5 hours per day, sitting for more than 10 hours daily was linked to a 2.5 times greater risk of premature death.”     link       “Truth is a pathless land”.     Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique.     He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.       Man has built in himself images as a fence of security—religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols, ideas, beliefs. The burden of these images dominates man’s thinking, his relationships, and his daily life. These images are the causes of our problems for they divide man from man. His perception of life is shaped by the concepts already established in his mind.     The content of his consciousness is his entire existence. The individuality is the name, the form and superficial culture he acquires from tradition and environment. The uniqueness of man does not lie in the superficial but in complete freedom from the content of his consciousness, which is common to all humanity. So he is not an individual.       Most of the activities we care about in life are infinite games. Businesses don’t “win” the market and quit. Health isn’t over once you’ve reached your weight-loss goal. Even knowledge decays and renews as you learn more things.     Conversely, if you can keep going you haven’t lost. Apple was on the brink of disaster just over two decades ago. Yet the game kept playing and they wound up as the most valuable company in the world. At least for now.     Stamina is the central virtue in a world full of infinite games.       “You can’t always choose the path that you walk in life, but you can always choose the manner in which you walk it.” — John O’ Leary, On Fire       “Constantly scanning the world for the negative comes with a great cost. It undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers our motivation and ability to accomplish goals.” — Shawn Achor, the Happiness Advantage       A group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant’s body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience, and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest, and they come to blows.     The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people’s limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.       “The place to improve the world is first in one’s own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there.” — Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance       Do less, do what you do better, don’t get distracted along the way.       If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.       What matters is going out there and doing it, not thinking about it, not worrying what others might think, not even being attached to a result, just doing it. - Andy Puddicombe       There is a high chance that 50% of what we know is not true.     And the best part is that we don’t know which 50%.       Most people fool themselves by saying they’ll be happy once they have something or once a certain situation changes.     The truth is that your happiness doesn’t depend on things.     It depends on your inner world and your ability to focus on the things you’re grateful for, even when difficulties arise.       When people reflect on what it takes to be mentally fit, the first idea that comes to mind is usually intelligence. The smarter you are, the more complex the problems you can solve— and the faster you can solve them. Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.     Mental horsepower doesn’t guarantee mental dexterity. No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you’ll miss many occasions to think again. Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for ste­reotypes, because you’re faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs.     The curse of knowledge is that it closes your mind to what you don’t know. Good judgment depends on having the skill— and the will— to open your mind. A hallmark of wisdom is knowing when it’s time to abandon some of the most cherished parts of your identity.     — Adam Grant in Think Again       “At 20, you are constantly worrying about what other people think of you. At 40 you wake up and say, ‘I’m not going to give a damn what other people think anymore.’ And at 60 you realize no one is thinking about you at all.”     The most important piece of information there:  “Nobody is thinking about you from the very beginning.”   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   Happiness is not a consumable product. It is not something you find by searching for it. It is a naturally arising byproduct of a fulfilling, well-lived life.     A well-lived life has more to do with perspective than anything else. As long as you can laugh, there is hope.       There are big, hard-to-implement, habits. And then there are small, easy-to-implement, habits. I love both but it’s clear the latter ones are easier to add to our already (seemingly) busy life.     All things considered, they are also life-changing in the very long run. The only difficulty with those is how hidden their impact is. It’s easy to drop them because you don’t see how useful they are. Keep at them for long enough and your life will improve.     You can start changing your life. You can be happier with tiny changes. Hey, you can even start today.       One day you’ll wake up and shake your head and wonder where all that time went. Then you’ll ask “did I make the most of it?” And, with your whole heart, you’ll want the answer to be yes.     Do what you can now to get to yes.       It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, is poor.       “Anything that costs you your health, relationships, or happiness isn’t really a success.”          “Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit when you don’t know something, and to learn something new.”         Barack Obama         Quite often, we allow others to dictate how we should live and behave instead of listening to our deepest desires.     Answering the following questions might help you get closer to the person you want to be.     Who am I when I don’t follow others’ expectations?     Am I holding on to something I need to let go of?     What matters most in my life?     How do I want to live, knowing I will die?     Does it matter what others think about me?     What would I do if I knew I couldn’t fail?       “So long as an opinion is strongly rooted in the feelings, it gains rather than loses stability by having a preponderating weight of argument against it.” -John Mill     Our rationales are dangerously burdened by our emotions and sense of identity.     The lottery is a tax on people who can’t do the math. Arguing on the internet is a tax on people who don’t value their time.       Every human is a walking science experiment. We are composed of chemicals that swirl and change based on the thousands of decisions we make each day. When people act in reckless disregard for their chemical nature, it poisons any happiness initiative. They take up meditation but then they binge drink. They manage their work-life balance but stay in dysfunctional relationships. They eat healthy but stay up until 3 AM on their phone every night.     Avoid deal-breaker habits.       It might feel good at the moment to break the rules. But mark my words, there’s a sinking feeling that comes later on.     Be willing to say no when it is most difficult.       “The best fighter is never angry.” ― Lao Tzu          Most of us are so used to complaining and negative thinking that we don’t even realize how these habits are holding us back from living a great life.     But here’s the truth: The more you complain, the more negativity you’ll find.     We’re all human and it’s okay to experience negative situations and emotions, but we can always choose how we react to them.     And the reality is that you always have two choices: You can either complain about something or look for a solution.     If you can change the situation, do it.     If you can’t do anything about it, move on and focus on the next best thing.       You teach people how to treat you by showing them how you treat yourself.       In today’s fast-paced world, most people feel stressed before there’s anything to stress about. They’re so used to being overwhelmed that they don’t even expect their lives to be easy and enjoyable.     And that’s exactly the problem: You attract what you expect. If you expect difficulty, you’ll find it. If you expect beautiful experiences, your focus will shift and you’ll discover more of them.     And the reality is that most of our negative feelings are caused by a lack of mindfulness. You barely feel stressed about something that’s happening right now.          Social media can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how you choose to use it. It’s neither good nor bad, it’s just a tool and you can decide how to integrate it into your life.     Whatever you do, don’t allow it to mess up with your inner world. Instead, make sure you get to see what you want to see. If you’re careful about your usage, social media can indeed help you become a better and happier person.     And don’t forget that social media is just a TINY excerpt of reality.       The best response is often “You’re probably right.”     Nothing is gained by arguing with someone over something that doesn’t matter.       When it comes to making decisions, your environment matters. Just as it’s hard to eat healthy if your kitchen is full of junk food, it’s hard to make good decisions when you’re too busy to think. Just as the kitchen influences what you eat, your office/environment influences how you make decisions.     Most of us make decisions in an environment where it is very hard for us to behave rationally.       Leave it better than you found it. Just because you struggled doesn’t mean everyone needs to.     It can be anything: code, ideas, person.       We often talk about everything we have to do on a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.     Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.     You “get” to wake up early for work. You “get” to make another sales call for your business. You “get” to cook dinner for your family.       “You are a jigsaw puzzle piece of a certain shape. You could change your shape to fit an existing hole in the world. That was the traditional plan. But there’s another way that can often be better for you and for the world: to grow a new puzzle around you.”       Why do I get angry when I am insulted?     A: Because you entertain the verity of the insult.     -Kapil Gupta       “One lesson I’ve learned is that if the job I do were easy, I wouldn’t derive so much satisfaction from it. The thrill of winning is in direct proportion to the effort I put in before. I also know, from long experience, that if you make an effort in training when you don’t especially feel like making it, the payoff is that you will win games when you are not feeling your best. That is how you win championships, that is what separates the great player from the merely good player. The difference lies in how well you’ve prepared.”     — Rafael Nadal       In dwelling, live close to the ground.     In thinking, keep it to the simple.     In conflict, be fair and generous,     In governing, don’t try to control.     In work, do what you enjoy.     In family life, be completely present.     When you are content to be simply yourself     And don’t compare or compete,     Everybody will respect you.       It is hard to have a phone. I mean, yeah, it is also fun to have a phone, but you know how addicted you are to it. You realize that it is pulling you all the time. And when it pulls you, it sometimes tells you something that you don’t want to hear: You get a mean email from a friend or a conflict-y text or not enough people liked your Instagram post or someone thinks something is wrong with your Instagram post and has commented about it and their comment has gone semi-viral. Then you have to stop everything and deal with that. It is exhausting. It is a lot. If, right now, you can let yourself put your phone away for the next 90 minutes, that would be a gift you could give yourself.     You would be letting yourself be present.       The right solution is expensive. The wrong one costs a fortune.       In a society that is obsessed with hard work and career success,     seeking boredom is an act of rebellion.       The best way to change your entire life is by not changing your entire life. Instead, it is best to focus on one specific habit, work on it until you master it, and make it an automatic part of your daily life. Then, repeat the process for the next habit.     link       A big problem is just a bunch of small problems combined. Learn to separate them out.     It’s all a matter of approach.       “I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences. That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less energy they expend on your prose, the more they’ll have left for your ideas.” — Write Simply       “I don’t trust people who don’t love themselves and tell me ‘I love you.’ … There is an African saying which is: ‘Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt.’” — Maya Angelou       “[T]here’s just the status quo bias that naturally ensues from “well, we have a working system; that system naturally resists change”. The period of the early twentieth century was an era of building in the broadest sense, from universities to government agencies to cities to highways. The byproduct of this period of building is maintenance and we haven’t figured out how to meta-maintain – that is, how to avoid emergent sclerosis in the stuff we build. … The “enemy”, such as it is, is the calcification that follows from an existing install base. And all cultural questions aside, the US simply has a very large existing install base of aged institutions and systems.” — Patrick Collison   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   When you care more about getting things right than being right, you get better outcomes and you save time and energy.       “A year from now you will wish you had started today.” — Karen Lamb       In reality, addiction can form to just about anything. We attach moral reasoning to it after the fact. The key to solving addiction is to remove stigma and shame, not drown people in it.     People like to use their moral reasoning in order to inflict pain and suffering on everyone else. They see it as imperative to impose their own beliefs on others. They think by cleansing the world, then they’ll cleanse themselves.     Instead of focusing on their own actions and behaviours, they identify the root cause in something outside themselves — an exterior enemy that has to be eradicated in order for them to feel wholesome. They project this hate toward anyone who’s not like them.     In reality, they love sin.     They hate the sinner.       The fastest learners are young children because they don’t care what other people think about them. When they fall, they pull themselves right back up – hundreds of times – because they want to walk and don’t care who is watching them fall in the process. As we grow older, we are not only ashamed when we fall, we are afraid before we even try something new that someone will criticize us.     Learning is a lifelong process as we fall and pull ourselves up, sometimes hundreds of times. But like children who are determined to walk, we can keep uncovering the limiting beliefs that block us from moving forward and change them, one truth and one step at a time.       “The more I know - the more I know that I don’t know.” - Richard Feynman       Being bored takes courage.     Most of us would rather occupy ourselves with our phone, a book, or even the back of a cereal box rather than sit still with no distractions. But this reluctance to be alone with ourselves comes at a cost.     It means we may never discover what boredom actually is: a diving board into the deep end of our mind—and a gateway to something bigger and more profound.     The truth is, there are many astonishing insights waiting for us on the other side of boredom. But to access these insights, we first need to set aside our comforting distractions, if only for a moment at a time.       Being busy isn’t the same thing as adding value.       “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.” — H. L. Hunt       “If we see someone throwing money away, we call that person crazy. Money has value. Wasting it seems nuts. And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time.”     — The Shortness of Time       “The flaws you see in others are actually a reflection of yourself.” — Eve Branson     Coming to terms with this requires you to drop your ego and be humble, but when you do, you can get to the root of the trouble and start working on yourself.       “What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” — George Eliot       You see the world through your perspective, just as everyone else views it through theirs.     People often form assumptions about others’ behaviour based on their own. If they don’t trust others, chances are it’s because they know others can’t trust them.          Nowadays, a person who is listening without his phone and focuses on what you say with intentions — is a blessing. If we start to think about it is even depressing. How have we changed over time?     Few people are listeners because of their busy life. Nobody even has the necessity to talk and opt for scrolling their phones to check their social media instead. Finally, you make that choice to spend more time focusing on that rather than have a real interaction with a real person.     The person who cares for you is the person who is taking the time to listen and understand your needs.       “If I had an hour to save the world, I’d spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” - Einstein     The act of analyzing and examining assumptions is what makes solutions appear in plain sight.     Stay in search of the clearest definition of your life’s problems.          I’ve found that there is no running from who you are. When things don’t feel right, it reflects a lack of alignment in your life. Who you are and what you are doing is no longer compatible.     Time spent unhappy is an abject waste. Never stop searching for your true path. Even if you never find it, it’s better to die searching than to have never looked at all.       Don’t become a “spiritual person.”     There are many good reasons why a person might choose to meditate—the classic reason being to reduce psychological suffering. Paradoxically, this is accomplished not by trying to avoid or improve one’s experience, but by clearly observing how thoughts and emotions arise, proliferate, and become enshrined in behaviour.     Seeing the whole apparatus at work can be incredibly freeing.     So, seeking to get rid of suffering—whether it’s anxiety, fear, anger, or any other negative emotion—is what brings most people to the practice. And there’s nothing wrong with that starting point.     But there are some misguided reasons to practice meditation. And chief among them is seeking to become a spiritual person. To become a “good meditator.” It’s all too easy to grow more and more precious with your new spiritual ideas and beliefs, and to begin annoying everyone around you.     To be clear, the mistake isn’t in being excited about the benefits of meditation. It’s natural to feel good that you’re training your mind in this way, and to want to share your experience with others.     The mistake lies in forming a new identity out of spiritual life. And then failing to see it.          There is only one way to achieve any goal - fall in love with the journey. And when you reach the goal, you might realize that the journey was way more fun than winning the trophy.       If you are not going to have the courage to take the path you wish to take, despite what the world thinks of you, despite what the world tells you to do, despite all the obstacles that you can foresee, only because it makes you truly happy     No one is going to do it for you.       What society wants for you, may not always be good for you. Society is a large group. And groups search for consensus, individuals search for truth.     It is not acceptable for society to tell you the truth in many things. There are many things that society throws at you all day long, even if you are a smart and critical person, you just believe. But you may be forced and dive deep down, you will find that those are not true.          “I said: what about my eyes? He said: Keep them on the road.     I said: What about my passion? He said: Keep it burning.     I said: What about my heart? He said: Tell me what you hold inside it?     I said: Pain and sorrow. He said: Stay with it. The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” ― Attributed to Rumi       Our lives aren’t measured by how many people inspire us, but rather how many people we inspire. Just do yourself a favour and don’t overthink what and how you can begin to best support your target.     If I’ve learned anything in life, it’s that big gestures aren’t always what leads to people’s breakthroughs. In fact, for me personally, it was “little” words and actions from people whom I respected that ultimately sparked my fight.       Figuring out what you want to do with your life is a massive question. It’s easy to understand why people feel like they’re behind, as social media paints a picture that everyone is living their best lives but us.     But I don’t know about you, I’d rather support someone’s uncurated picture of them giving training to a group of kids over them talking about how warm the water is in Barbados.     So if you want to be truly rich, don’t get distracted by the big noise — and instead, go small by getting clear on what you can do with what you have to positively impact the people in front of you.       Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief.     A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others. This is what everyone throughout the world is attempting to do. Truth is narrowed down and made a plaything for those who are weak, for those who are only momentarily discontented.     Truth cannot be brought down, rather the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountain-top to the valley. If you would attain to the mountain-top you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.       Become more comfortable with being bored. Instead of grabbing your smartphone whenever you have nothing to do, just allow yourself to be bored and present at the moment.     By being present in the moment you train your mind to focus, contrasted with the distracted mindset you foster when constantly distracting yourself with the torrent of information available on social media and the like.       The world is designed to make our lives comfortable. So it tricks us into believing that life’s purpose is to chase comfort.     And therein lies the contradiction.     Avoiding the comfort trap is the difference between who you are and who you could have been.       “Like our stomachs, our minds are hurt more often by overeating than by hunger.”   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.     His procedure was simple: on the final day of class, he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.     Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.          Meditation is not engaging in some pleasant or interesting experience in order to generate positive feelings. It’s not about tuning out the world and coming to a place of inner peace.     True meditation is the ability to recognize what your mind is like, prior to being lost in thought. When you’re engaged in meditation, you’re no longer identifying with every thought, reaction, whim, or emotion that comes barreling into your mind.     However, once you know how to practice, it is true to say that any activity can be synonymous with meditation. You can recognize the nature of your mind at any point, in any location, under any circumstance. But this must first be practised in formal sessions.     So, yes. You can meditate while hiking, running, biking or doing anything else a human being can do. But only after you know how to practice.       We all know people who behave very differently depending on who they’re around. Someone who’s polite, deferential, and accommodating with their grandmother can morph into a jerk when speaking with a customer service agent.     Now, it’s easy to judge these people as being two-faced or disingenuous. But it’s instructive to notice that we’re all in this situation to varying degrees.     For instance, who we are on a Zoom call with a client likely feels different than whom we are when speaking with a family member or friend.     The core of whom we take ourselves to seem to remain intact, yet the face we wear seems to change, whether subtly or dramatically. It’s as if we have a collection of masks that we reflexively put on, depending on who’s in front of us.     As you go about your day today, notice how your sense of self changes depending on whom you interact with. Notice the mask you’re wearing in each interaction.     And realize that it’s not who you really are.       What’s something that looks way riskier than it actually is?     Here’s my answer: Asking. For anything!     I would love to know your thoughts.        If you tolerate too much half-heartedness, it’s probably because you’re half-hearted. As in: anxious and ambivalent, looking for reassurance. As in: bored, along for the ride, not really sure about your own feelings and opinions. As in: external locus of control vs internal locus of control. You probably don’t have anything in your life that really tethers you to yourself—you don’t have conviction about what you love, so you’re hoping that someone else will provide you that certainty.     I think that people come alive when they’re serious about what they love—when they choose to pay careful attention to what feeds and sustains them.   ","categories": ["statuses"],
