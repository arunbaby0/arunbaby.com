        "excerpt":"The former is about taking, whereas the latter is all about giving. One is short-lived and the other is long-lived.   How many of us prioritise happiness over pleasure? When does the pleasure become indulgence? That last bag of Cheetos, one more episode in the NetFlix past midnight… Are those really helping us?   Please don’t confuse self-care with pleasure. Self-care is a necessity whereas the pleasure is completely optional.   The things which build up over a long term which doesn’t give instant joy mostly is related to happiness. For example, exercise, building skills can all bring happiness in the long run.   Is pleasure evil? No. It’s the imbalance which creates a real problem.   Which one do we long for? Which one should we prioritise? How do we balance? The real battle is within.  ","categories": ["thoughts"],

        "excerpt":"Education is the industrial process of making people compliant. Command and control is the backbone of it.  While learning is unleashing of a curious mind against the unknown. It is wandering through foreign territories. It can be guided or unguided.   The results that anyone wants to obtain through education is well defined. It can be a certificate or a degree. An external agency sets the limits for industrial education. The learner sets the limit for the learning.  Learning must be an engaging journey.   If you want to learn how to bicycle, don’t read a book, get on one and make mistakes. The fastest way to learn anything is by actively involving in an activity.   In the internet age, all you want to learn is a click away. Are we making use of all the resources that we have?      The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – Alvin Toffler    Please don’t confuse education with learning.

How many of your opinions are you reluctant to express inform of your friends/colleagues? Why so?   If the answer to the above question is ‘None’, step back and give it a thought. Odds are you are thinking in a way that you are told.   The other way to get the same answer is that you independently thought about each and every possibility for each of these scenarios and end up having the exact same answer. This is a highly unlikely scenario for obvious reasons.   Artists put voluntary mistakes so that they can identify when someone copies their work. So are mapmakers.   What are we trading for being conformist? If every generation had only conformists, the science/technology/medicine wouldn’t have evolved this much. It’s the outlaws/renegades/uncoventionals that bring real change to the world.   Use your brain, start thinking about why you are thinking what you think? Are you just already too much programmed?

Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War.

A person can have the same experience multiple times and still doesn’t learn anything. Think about a person who gets into relationship after relationship and just fail every time. What could that person have done differently?   Evaluated experience is the best teacher. Yes, evaluation is painful, so is not changing.   An evaluation may be painful for most of us. The length of the suffering can be reduced significantly if we are ready to evaluate and learn from the experience.  Others may cause pain, but we are causing suffering for us. Unfortunately, letting go is not that simple.   What experiences are worth evaluating? How often are we evaluating? What is the basis for the evaluation? All these are decided by us.

We often have some hard feeling towards someone because of the perspective of that person, but we equate the person to the perspective. They might have expressed something, which irritated you, because of their particular perspective.   A person’s perspective is not permanent. It changes for many reasons. It would be very easy to understand people once we understand this concept. Trying to understand the person’s perspective often opens the door to strengthen the relationship.   How do you separate the person from the perspective? Whenever you try to judge someone, take a pause and think why that person is thinking that way? This is applicable for ourself as well. Think about why we are thinking what we think to open the door to a different level of understanding.   P.S. If you are interested google “metacognition” and go down the rabbit hole.
