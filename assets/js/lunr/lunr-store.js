Importance of language corpora is recognized since long before in many countries. The amount of work in speech domain for Indian languages is comparatively lower than that of other languages. This demands the speech corpus for Indian languages. The corpus presented here is a database of speech audio files and corresponding text transcriptions. Various criteria are addressed while building the database for these languages namely, optimal text selection, speaker selection, pronunciation variation, recording specification, text correction for handling out-of-the-vocabulary words and so on. Furthermore, various characteristics that affect speech synthesis quality like encoding, sampling rate, channel, etc is considered so that the collected data will be of high quality with defined standards. Database and text to speech synthesizers are built for all the 13 languages, namely, Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Odiya, Rajasthani, Tamil and Telugu.

Murthy   Abstract:  This paper describes the design of a language independent parser for text-to-speech synthesis in Indian languages. Indian languages come from 5–6 different language families of the world. Most Indian languages have their own scripts. This makes parsing for text to speech systems for Indian languages a difficult task. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. Most importantly Indian languages are more or less phonetic and can be considered to consist broadly of about 35–38 consonants and 15–18 vowels. In this paper, an attempt is made to unify the languages based on this broad list of phones. A common label set is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. A uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of Indian languages. The proposed parser converts UTF-8 text to common label set, applies letter-to-sound rules and generates the corresponding phoneme sequences. The parser is tested against the custom-built parsers for multiple Indian languages. The TTS results show that the accuracy of the phoneme sequences generated by the proposed parser is more accurate than that of language specific parsers.

All around the world people are trying to build TTS voice for their regional languages. TTS voice building requires a number of steps to follow and involves use of multiple tools, which makes it time consuming, tedious and perplexing to a user. This paper describes a Toolkit developed for HMM-based TTS voice building that makes the process much easier and handy. The toolkit uses all required tools, viz. HTS, Festival, Festvox, Hybrid Segmentation Tool, etc. and handles each and every step starting from phone set creation, then prompt generation, hybrid segmentation, F0 range finding, voice building, and finally putting the built voice into Synthesis framework.

The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. In an earlier work, we had proposed the use of signal processing cues in tandem with GMM-HMM based forced alignment for boundary correction for building Indian language TTS systems. In this paper, we capitalise on the ability of robust acoustic modeling techniques such as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) for acoustic modeling. The GMM-HMM based forced alignment is replaced by DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM based forced alignment. Signal processing cues are used to correct the segment boundaries obtained using DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM segmentation. TTS systems built using these boundaries show a relative improvement in synthesis quality.   Cite:  @inproceedings{Baby2017,   author={Arun Baby and Jeena J. Prakash and Rupak Vignesh and Hema A.

There are two tasks that are crucial for building TTS systems, namely, parsing, and labeling.    Although Indian languages are more or less phonetic, parsing especially the issue of schwa deletion must be addressed carefully.   Accurate labeling of speech at the subword level is another important task. Owing to the nonavailability of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems in Indian languages, accurate labeling at the subword level is a difficult task.

Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manually (listening and marking), when digital resources are scarce. Manually labeling of data can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phonemes can be as short as 10ms. The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is, to perform forced alignment using monophone HMM models that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in a DNN/CNN framework to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues are used. The final waveforms are then used in an HMM based statistical parametric synthesis framework to build speech synthesis systems for 5 Indian languages. Qualitative assessments indicate that there is a significant improvement in quality of synthesis.   Cite:  NA   Links:   PDF   Code:  NA  ","categories": ["publications"],

Acoustic models are likely to be accurate provided the phone boundaries are determined accurately. Conventional flat-start based Viterbi phone alignment (where only utterance level transcriptions are available) results in poor phone boundaries as the boundaries are not explicitly modeled in any statistical machine learning system. The focus of the effort in this paper is to explicitly model phrase boundaries using acoustic cues obtained using signal processing. A phrase is made up of a sequence of words, where each word is made up of a sequence of syllables. Syllable boundaries are detected using signal processing. The waveform corresponding to an utterance is spliced at phrase boundaries when it matches a syllable boundary. Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) training is performed phrase by phrase, rather than utterance by utterance. Training using these short phrases yields better acoustic models. This alignment is then fed to a DNN to enable better discrimination between phones. During the training process, the syllable boundaries (obtained using signal processing) are restored in every iteration. A relative improvement is observed in WER over the baseline Indian languages, namely, Gujarati, Tamil, and Telugu.

        "excerpt":"[Conference] INTERSPEECH 2018, Hyderabad, India, September 2018   Authors:  Anju Leela Thomas, Anusha Prakash, Arun Baby, Hema Murthy   Abstract:  Most Indians are inherently bilingual or multilingual owing to the diverse linguistic culture in India. As a result, code-switching is quite common in conversational speech. The objective of this work is to train good quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers that can seamlessly handle code-switching. To achieve this, bilingual TTSes that are capable of handling phonotactic variations across languages are trained using combinations of monolingual data in a unified framework. In addition to segmenting Indic speech data using signal processing cues in tandem with hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN), we propose to segment Indian English data using the same approach after NIST syllabification. Then, bilingual HTS-STRAIGHT based systems are trained by randomizing the order of data so that the systematic interactions between the two languages are captured better. Experiments are conducted by considering three language pairs: Hindi+English, Tamil+English and Hindi+Tamil. The code-switched systems are evaluated on monolingual, code-mixed and code-switched texts. Degradation mean opinion score (DMOS) for monolingual sentences shows marginal degradation over that of an equivalent monolingual TTS system, while the DMOS for bilingual sentences is significantly better than that of the corresponding monolingual TTS systems.

        "excerpt":"[MS Thesis] IIT Madras: February 2019; Supervised by Prof. Hema A Murthy   Authors:  Arun Baby   Abstract:  India is a country with 22 official languages (written in 13 different scripts), 122 major languages and 1599 other languages.  These languages come from 5-6 different language families of the world.  It is only about 65% of this population that is literate, that too primarily in the vernacular.  Speech interfaces, especially in the vernacular, are enablers in such an environment.  Building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for such a diverse country necessitates a unified approach.  This research work aims to build Indian language TTS systems in a unified manner by exploiting the similarities that exist among these languages. Specifically, the focus is on two components of the TTS system, namely, text parsing and speech segmentation.   Parsing is the process of mapping graphemes to phonemes.  Indian languages are more or less phonetic and have about 35-38 consonants and 15-18 vowels. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. A Common Label Set (CLS) is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. In this work, a uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of these languages.   Segmentation is the process of finding phoneme boundaries in a speech utterance. The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. State-of-the-art  speech segmentation approach for speech segmentation in Indian languages is hybrid segmentation which uses signal processing cues along with GMM-HMM framework. Deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are known for robust acoustic modelling. In this work, signal processing cues, that are agnostic to speaker and language, are used in tandem with deep learning techniques to improve the phonetic segmentation.

        "excerpt":"[arXiv] arXiv, May 2020   Authors:  Arun Baby, Saranya Vinnaitherthan, Nagaraj Adiga, Pranav Jawale, Sumukh Badam, Sharath Adavanne, Srikanth Konjeti   Abstract:  The perceptual quality of neural text-to-speech (TTS) is highly dependent on the choice of the model during training. Selecting the model using a training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text. All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the proposed model selection method is language independent.

        "excerpt":"[Journal] Speech Communication: Volume 123, October 2020, Pages 10-25   Authors:  Arun Baby, Jeena J.Prakash, Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian, Hema A.Murthy   Abstract:  Building speech synthesis systems for Indian languages is challenging owing to the fact that digital resources for these languages are hardly available. Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manual (listening and marking) when digital resources are scarce. But the manual labeling of speech data (also known as speech segmentation) can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phones can be as short as 10ms.   The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is to perform forced alignment using monophone hidden Markov models (HMMs) that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in neural network frameworks to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis/recognition. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues like short-term energy (STE) and sub-band spectral flux (SBSF) are used in tandem with HMM based forced alignment for automatic speech segmentation.   STE and SBSF are computed on the speech waveforms. STE yields syllable boundaries, while SBSF provides locations of significant change in spectral flux that are indicative of fricatives, affricates, and nasals. STE and SBSF cannot be used directly to segment an utterance. Minimum phase group delay based smoothing is performed to preserve these landmarks, while at the same time reducing the local fluctuations. The boundaries obtained with HMMs are corrected at the syllable level, wherever it is known that the syllable boundaries are correct. Embedded re-estimation of monophone HMM models is again performed using the corrected alignment. Thus, using signal processing cues and HMM re-estimation in tandem, robust monophone HMM models are built. These models are then used in Gaussian mixture model (GMM), deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks to obtain state-level frame posteriors. The boundaries are again iteratively corrected and re-estimated.   Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built for different Indian languages using phone alignments obtained with and without the use of signal processing based boundary corrections. Unit selection based and statistical parametric based TTS systems are built. The result of the listening tests showed a significant improvement in the quality of synthesis with the use of signal processing based boundary correction.

The villagers lament his misfortune, and he replies “We’ll see.” The horse returns with four more horses, and the farmer is praised for his good luck. He replies, “We’ll see.” His son then attempts to break the horses, and breaks his leg. Again, the villagers console him for his bad luck. The reply again is “We’ll see.” Then the army comes and conscripts all the able-bodied young men, but the farmer’s son is spared. — Michael Sachse          The only real shortcut in life is to understand it backwards.

And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don’t seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don’t. Most people don’t even reach the stage of making something they’re embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They’re too frightened even to start.” —Early Work by Paul Graham          The right thing to do is often obvious. It’s not the choice that’s difficult so much as dealing with what the choice means. We have to have a hard conversation. We have to break someone’s heart. We have to do something hard. We have to break out of the prison of how other people think we should live. The price of avoiding these things is making yourself miserable. While the pain of dealing with reality is intense, it’s over rather quickly. The suffering of miserableness never really goes away. The choice of being miserable is the bargain you strike with yourself to avoid pain.

Instagram turns me covetous. All of them make me want to do it—whatever “it” may be—for the likes, the comments.

It’s hard to be a conformist if you don’t know what you’re supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out. It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you’re surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.  – Paul graham  link   ","categories": ["statuses"],
