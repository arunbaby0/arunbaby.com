When does the pleasure become indulgence? That last bag of Cheetos, one more episode in the NetFlix past midnight… Are those really helping us?   Please don’t confuse self-care with pleasure. Self-care is a necessity whereas the pleasure is completely optional.   The things which build up over a long term which doesn’t give instant joy mostly is related to happiness. For example, exercise, building skills can all bring happiness in the long run.   Is pleasure evil? No. It’s the imbalance which creates a real problem.   Which one do we long for? Which one should we prioritise? How do we balance? The real battle is within.  ","categories": ["thoughts"],
