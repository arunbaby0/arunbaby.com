Importance of language corpora is recognized since long before in many countries. The amount of work in speech domain for Indian languages is comparatively lower than that of other languages. This demands the speech corpus for Indian languages. The corpus presented here is a database of speech audio files and corresponding text transcriptions. Various criteria are addressed while building the database for these languages namely, optimal text selection, speaker selection, pronunciation variation, recording specification, text correction for handling out-of-the-vocabulary words and so on. Furthermore, various characteristics that affect speech synthesis quality like encoding, sampling rate, channel, etc is considered so that the collected data will be of high quality with defined standards. Database and text to speech synthesizers are built for all the 13 languages, namely, Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Odiya, Rajasthani, Tamil and Telugu.

Murthy   Abstract:  This paper describes the design of a language independent parser for text-to-speech synthesis in Indian languages. Indian languages come from 5–6 different language families of the world. Most Indian languages have their own scripts. This makes parsing for text to speech systems for Indian languages a difficult task. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. Most importantly Indian languages are more or less phonetic and can be considered to consist broadly of about 35–38 consonants and 15–18 vowels. In this paper, an attempt is made to unify the languages based on this broad list of phones. A common label set is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. A uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of Indian languages. The proposed parser converts UTF-8 text to common label set, applies letter-to-sound rules and generates the corresponding phoneme sequences. The parser is tested against the custom-built parsers for multiple Indian languages. The TTS results show that the accuracy of the phoneme sequences generated by the proposed parser is more accurate than that of language specific parsers.

Beyond the communication aids for the visually impaired and vocally handicap, TTS voices are being used in various educational, telecommunication and multimedia applications. All around the world people are trying to build TTS voice for their regional languages. TTS voice building requires a number of steps to follow and involves use of multiple tools, which makes it time consuming, tedious and perplexing to a user. This paper describes a Toolkit developed for HMM-based TTS voice building that makes the process much easier and handy. The toolkit uses all required tools, viz. HTS, Festival, Festvox, Hybrid Segmentation Tool, etc. and handles each and every step starting from phone set creation, then prompt generation, hybrid segmentation, F0 range finding, voice building, and finally putting the built voice into Synthesis framework.

The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. In an earlier work, we had proposed the use of signal processing cues in tandem with GMM-HMM based forced alignment for boundary correction for building Indian language TTS systems. In this paper, we capitalise on the ability of robust acoustic modeling techniques such as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) for acoustic modeling. The GMM-HMM based forced alignment is replaced by DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM based forced alignment. Signal processing cues are used to correct the segment boundaries obtained using DNN-HMM/CNN-HMM segmentation. TTS systems built using these boundaries show a relative improvement in synthesis quality.   Cite:  @inproceedings{Baby2017,   author={Arun Baby and Jeena J. Prakash and Rupak Vignesh and Hema A.

There are two tasks that are crucial for building TTS systems, namely, parsing, and labeling.    Although Indian languages are more or less phonetic, parsing especially the issue of schwa deletion must be addressed carefully.   Accurate labeling of speech at the subword level is another important task. Owing to the nonavailability of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems in Indian languages, accurate labeling at the subword level is a difficult task.

Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manually (listening and marking), when digital resources are scarce. Manually labeling of data can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phonemes can be as short as 10ms. The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is, to perform forced alignment using monophone HMM models that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in a DNN/CNN framework to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues are used. The final waveforms are then used in an HMM based statistical parametric synthesis framework to build speech synthesis systems for 5 Indian languages. Qualitative assessments indicate that there is a significant improvement in quality of synthesis.   Cite:  NA   Links:   PDF   Code:  NA  ","categories": ["publications"],

Acoustic models are likely to be accurate provided the phone boundaries are determined accurately. Conventional flat-start based Viterbi phone alignment (where only utterance level transcriptions are available) results in poor phone boundaries as the boundaries are not explicitly modeled in any statistical machine learning system. The focus of the effort in this paper is to explicitly model phrase boundaries using acoustic cues obtained using signal processing. A phrase is made up of a sequence of words, where each word is made up of a sequence of syllables. Syllable boundaries are detected using signal processing. The waveform corresponding to an utterance is spliced at phrase boundaries when it matches a syllable boundary. Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) training is performed phrase by phrase, rather than utterance by utterance. Training using these short phrases yields better acoustic models. This alignment is then fed to a DNN to enable better discrimination between phones. During the training process, the syllable boundaries (obtained using signal processing) are restored in every iteration. A relative improvement is observed in WER over the baseline Indian languages, namely, Gujarati, Tamil, and Telugu.

As a result, code-switching is quite common in conversational speech. The objective of this work is to train good quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers that can seamlessly handle code-switching. To achieve this, bilingual TTSes that are capable of handling phonotactic variations across languages are trained using combinations of monolingual data in a unified framework. In addition to segmenting Indic speech data using signal processing cues in tandem with hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN), we propose to segment Indian English data using the same approach after NIST syllabification. Then, bilingual HTS-STRAIGHT based systems are trained by randomizing the order of data so that the systematic interactions between the two languages are captured better. Experiments are conducted by considering three language pairs: Hindi+English, Tamil+English and Hindi+Tamil. The code-switched systems are evaluated on monolingual, code-mixed and code-switched texts. Degradation mean opinion score (DMOS) for monolingual sentences shows marginal degradation over that of an equivalent monolingual TTS system, while the DMOS for bilingual sentences is significantly better than that of the corresponding monolingual TTS systems.

        "excerpt":"[MS Thesis] IIT Madras: February 2019; Supervised by Prof. Hema A Murthy   Authors:  Arun Baby   Abstract:  India is a country with 22 official languages (written in 13 different scripts), 122 major languages and 1599 other languages.  These languages come from 5-6 different language families of the world.  It is only about 65% of this population that is literate, that too primarily in the vernacular.  Speech interfaces, especially in the vernacular, are enablers in such an environment.  Building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for such a diverse country necessitates a unified approach.  This research work aims to build Indian language TTS systems in a unified manner by exploiting the similarities that exist among these languages. Specifically, the focus is on two components of the TTS system, namely, text parsing and speech segmentation.   Parsing is the process of mapping graphemes to phonemes.  Indian languages are more or less phonetic and have about 35-38 consonants and 15-18 vowels. In spite of the number of different families which leads to divergence, there is a convergence owing to borrowings across language families. A Common Label Set (CLS) is defined to represent the various phones in Indian languages. In this work, a uniform parser is designed across all the languages capitalising on the syllable structure of these languages.   Segmentation is the process of finding phoneme boundaries in a speech utterance. The main drawback of the Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based forced-alignment is that the phoneme boundaries are not explicitly modeled. State-of-the-art  speech segmentation approach for speech segmentation in Indian languages is hybrid segmentation which uses signal processing cues along with GMM-HMM framework. Deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are known for robust acoustic modelling. In this work, signal processing cues, that are agnostic to speaker and language, are used in tandem with deep learning techniques to improve the phonetic segmentation.

Selecting the model using a training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text. All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the proposed model selection method is language independent.

        "excerpt":"[Journal] Speech Communication: Volume 123, October 2020, Pages 10-25   Authors:  Arun Baby, Jeena J.Prakash, Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian, Hema A.Murthy   Abstract:  Building speech synthesis systems for Indian languages is challenging owing to the fact that digital resources for these languages are hardly available. Vocabulary independent speech synthesis requires that a given text is split at the level of the smallest sound unit, namely, phone. The waveforms or models of phones are concatenated to produce speech. The waveforms corresponding to that of the phones are obtained manual (listening and marking) when digital resources are scarce. But the manual labeling of speech data (also known as speech segmentation) can lead to inconsistencies as the duration of phones can be as short as 10ms.   The most common approach to automatic segmentation of speech is to perform forced alignment using monophone hidden Markov models (HMMs) that have been obtained using embedded re-estimation after flat start initialization. These results are then used in neural network frameworks to build better acoustic models for speech synthesis/recognition. Segmentation using this approach requires large amounts of data and does not work very well for low resource languages. To address the issue of paucity of data, signal processing cues like short-term energy (STE) and sub-band spectral flux (SBSF) are used in tandem with HMM based forced alignment for automatic speech segmentation.   STE and SBSF are computed on the speech waveforms. STE yields syllable boundaries, while SBSF provides locations of significant change in spectral flux that are indicative of fricatives, affricates, and nasals. STE and SBSF cannot be used directly to segment an utterance. Minimum phase group delay based smoothing is performed to preserve these landmarks, while at the same time reducing the local fluctuations. The boundaries obtained with HMMs are corrected at the syllable level, wherever it is known that the syllable boundaries are correct. Embedded re-estimation of monophone HMM models is again performed using the corrected alignment. Thus, using signal processing cues and HMM re-estimation in tandem, robust monophone HMM models are built. These models are then used in Gaussian mixture model (GMM), deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks to obtain state-level frame posteriors. The boundaries are again iteratively corrected and re-estimated.   Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built for different Indian languages using phone alignments obtained with and without the use of signal processing based boundary corrections. Unit selection based and statistical parametric based TTS systems are built. The result of the listening tests showed a significant improvement in the quality of synthesis with the use of signal processing based boundary correction.

Their English is of a non-native kind, and their conversations are of a code-mixed fashion. The intelligibility of a bilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system for such non-native English speakers depends on a lexicon that captures the phoneme sequence used by non-native speakers. However, due to the lack of non-native English lexicon, existing bilingual TTS systems employ native English lexicons that are widely available, in addition to their native language lexicon. Due to the inconsistency between the non-native English pronunciation in the audio and native English lexicon in the text, the intelligibility of synthesized speech in such TTS systems is significantly reduced. This paper is motivated by the knowledge that the native language of the speaker highly influences non-native English pronunciation. We propose a generic approach to obtain rules based on letter to phoneme alignment to map native English lexicon to their non-native version. The effectiveness of such mapping is studied by comparing bilingual (Indian English and Hindi) TTS systems trained with and without the proposed rules. The subjective evaluation shows that the bilingual TTS system trained with the proposed non-native English lexicon rules obtains a 6% absolute improvement in preference.

Many existing methods focus on modeling OOV words by modifying acoustic and language models and integrating context words cleverly into models. To train such complex models, we need a large amount of data with context words, additional training time, and increased model size. However, after getting the ASR transcription to recover context-based OOV words, the post-processing method has not been explored much. In this work, we propose a post-processing technique to improve the performance of context-based OOV recovery. We created an acoustically boosted language model with a sub-graph made at phone level with an OOV words list. We proposed two methods to determine a suitable cost function to retrieve the OOV words based on the context. The cost function is defined based on phonetic and acoustic knowledge for matching and recovering the correct context words in the decode. The effectiveness of the proposed cost function is evaluated at both word-level and sentence-level. The evaluation results show that this approach can recover an average of 50% context-based OOV words across multiple categories.

He replies, “We’ll see.” His son then attempts to break the horses, and breaks his leg. Again, the villagers console him for his bad luck.

We have to have a hard conversation. We have to break someone’s heart. We have to do something hard. We have to break out of the prison of how other people think we should live.

        "excerpt":"   “A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought—they must be earned.”       “Oh ye who cannot take a good rub, how would you ever become a polished gem.” ~ Rumi       “When you change the way you see things, the things you see change.” — Wayne Dyer       “Am I part of the cure? Or am I part of the disease?” — Coldplay          Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting.  You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.       “There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche       Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to.          If you listen to successful people talk about their methods, remember that all the people who used the same methods and failed did not make videos/write about it.       Noticing biases in others is easy, noticing biases in yourself is hard. However, it has much higher pay-off.          Selfish people should listen to advice to be more selfless, selfless people should listen to advice to be more selfish. This applies to many things.  Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most.       Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap.       Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’          Compliment people more.  Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else.  You can help them out.       If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.          Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature.  It’s cheap to experiment with these.       You have vanishingly little political influence and every thought you spend on politics will probably come to nothing.  Consider building things instead, or at least going for a walk.       Liking and wanting things are different.  There are things like junk food that you want beyond enjoyment. But you can also like things (like reading) without wanting them.  If you remember enjoying something but don’t feel a desire for it now, try pushing yourself.       Bad things happen dramatically (a pandemic). Good things happen gradually (malaria deaths dropping annually) and don’t feel like ‘news’.  Endeavour to keep track of the good things to avoid an inaccurate and dismal view of the world.

        "excerpt":"   “If you ever want to have peace in your life, you have to move beyond good and evil.”     “Nature has no concept of happiness or unhappiness. Nature follows unbroken mathematical laws and a chain of cause and effect from the Big Bang to now. Everything is perfect exactly the way it is. It is only in our particular minds we are unhappy or not happy, and things are perfect or imperfect because of what we desire.”       “Real happiness only comes as a side-effect of peace. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment.”       “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” —Buddhist saying       Doctors won’t make you healthy. Nutritionists won’t make you slim. Teachers won’t make you smart. Gurus won’t make you calm. Mentors won’t make you rich. Trainers won’t make you fit.     Ultimately, you have to take responsibility. Save yourself.       When everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease.       “The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.”       “You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you’re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future.”       “Impatience with actions, patience with results.”     When you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don’t really want to change—we don’t want to go through the pain just yet.     At least recognize it, be aware of it, and give yourself a smaller change you can actually carry out.       “Don’t spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you’re happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy. ”     “If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it’s your problem. But, if they have an expectation of you, that’s completely their problem. It has nothing to do with you. They’re going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you can dash their expectations, the better. ”       People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.       The modern struggle:     Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising…     Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs.       How to be wrong a lot less often? Know the other side of the argument better than they do.     I’m not entitled to have an opinion on any subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think that only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.       Self-serving bias; you want to get that out of yourself; thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self.          “Just because you like it does not mean that the world will necessarily give it to you.”       “Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.” “Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.”       “In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.” ― Mortimer J. Adler       If we are always glued to our phones, even when going to the bathroom, then we can’t tolerate even 5 min of boredom. And if so, how will we do worthwhile things in life?     To do anything meaningful, we have to be willing to slog and make peace with boredom. Good doctors undergo years of mind-numbing studies. Glamorous sounding jobs like consulting and banking can be murderously tedious. To do breakthrough research, scientists read through reams of research papers, filled with dense math, jargon, and technical details.       To do worthwhile things, we have to overcome our addiction to constant excitement. Once in a while, let us do nothing for some time - embrace boredom, and be with our thoughts.     We are always busy connecting with others. Today, why not try connecting with yourself?       It’s too much work to change our minds. It’s too much work to dance with the fear of failure. It’s too much work to imagine walking through the world differently.     That doesn’t have to be the case. We can refuse to be brainwashed into accepting the status quo, and we can commit to finding the others, engaging with them and leveling up.     If we care enough.       Walking for 10 km carrying a heavy bag is misery. But when we call it hiking, we love it.     The experience is the same - it is neither good nor bad. It is what our mind makes it to be.     More often than not, the misery, as well as the happiness we experience, is manufactured by our mind.       Addiction is the inability to control our urge for something we know is harmful and which leaves us dissatisfied after its use. The more we use it, the more desensitized we become and need higher doses to get the same high.     Does it ring a bell?       Those who know themselves and maximize their strengths are the ones who go where they want to go.     Those who don’t know themselves, and avoid the hard work of looking inward, live life by default. They lack the ability to create for themselves their own future.       It is better to be lost and busy in the chase of finding yourself, instead of being lost and busy in the rat race of never knowing yourself.       Wherever you are in life, and based on who is around you, and based on your current aspirations, those are the things that shape your beliefs.     Nobody explains, though, that “beliefs” then are not “fixed.” There is no “right and wrong.” It is all relative.     Find what works for you.       The average person spends 2 hours and 24 minutes every day checking social media. (This can further affect happiness because there’s an association between screen time and depression.) Yet people often wish they had more time to travel, read, exercise, learn a language, spend time with loved ones, etc. — all of which can help boost joy, fulfilment, and positivity.     link     Something doesn’t add up. Cut out all social media and news consumption for two weeks and see what happens.     What will you do with your extra two hours each day?       Growing up is the realization that you are both the sculpture and the sculptor, the painter and the portrait.     Paint yourself however you wish.       “It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.” — Bruce Lee       Ultimately, if you can’t be happy without those things, then you can’t be happy with them.     That’s not to say you should never try to achieve anything in life. Instead, try to reach goals without making happiness depend on them — in other words, without attaching happiness to them. It creates far more freedom, ease, and peace.     And if you ever happened to lose what you had, you won’t be as devastated because it was never the source of your happiness in the first place.

        "excerpt":"   “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body, ”- Richard Steele.       Choose your role models carefully.     Those with the loudest voices rarely offer the wisest insights.     The best advice often is to just “find someone who has what you want, and ignore the rest.”       “I wonder what it is that the more we have, the more we become prisoners at the thought of losing it, rather than setting us free.”       There’s no quicker path to misery than conditional happiness.     When the high dissipates, we seek the next one, finding happiness only when we achieve a goal; everything in between is just filler.     If you can’t find happiness during the pursuit, it won’t last long when you reach the finish line. Find joy in the journey, and if it eludes you, reassess your mission.          It’s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.     The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.     link       Memory is an intrinsic part of our life experience. It is critical for learning, and without memories we would have no sense of self.     Understanding why some memories stick better than others, as well as accepting their fluidity, helps us reduce conflict and better appreciate just how much our memories impact our lives.       “Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.” — Lao Tzu       Often injustice lies in what you aren’t doing, not only in what you are doing.       “The student as a boxer, not a fencer.” Why?     Because the fencer has a weapon they must pick up. A boxer’s weapons are a part of him, he and the weapon are one.     Same goes for knowledge, philosophy and wisdom.       It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.          Kindness isn’t always easy or obvious, because the urgent race to the bottom, to easily measured metrics and to scarcity, can distract us. But bending the arc toward justice, toward dignity and toward connection is our best way forward.     Kindness multiplies and it enables possibility. When we’re of service to people, we have the chance to make things better.       “The wise man knows exactly what value should be put upon everything.” — Seneca       “The best way to avenge yourself is to not be like that.”       It is easy to connect over mutual dislike, but it is a toxic practice.     Work on talking about books, or ideas, or travel, or anything else you find even mildly interesting.       I think it’s fair to assert that sometimes, our moods are handed to us.     But it’s also clearly true that we can do things to improve our mood. Morning pages, meditation, exercise, positive thinking, the right audio inputs, who we hang out with, the media we consume–it’s all a choice.     And if it’s a choice, that means it’s a skill, because we can get better at it.       What was true 5 years ago may not be true now, and yet, both were true for you at some point in time.     Embracing the paradoxes of life — that often, conflicting ideas can both be true in their own ways — will save you a lot of stress.       “The dangers of prolonged sitting in an earlier study that showed that, compared with sitting for under 6.5 hours per day, sitting for more than 10 hours daily was linked to a 2.5 times greater risk of premature death.”     link       “Truth is a pathless land”.     Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique.     He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.       Man has built in himself images as a fence of security—religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols, ideas, beliefs. The burden of these images dominates man’s thinking, his relationships, and his daily life. These images are the causes of our problems for they divide man from man. His perception of life is shaped by the concepts already established in his mind.     The content of his consciousness is his entire existence. The individuality is the name, the form and superficial culture he acquires from tradition and environment. The uniqueness of man does not lie in the superficial but in complete freedom from the content of his consciousness, which is common to all humanity. So he is not an individual.       Most of the activities we care about in life are infinite games. Businesses don’t “win” the market and quit. Health isn’t over once you’ve reached your weight-loss goal. Even knowledge decays and renews as you learn more things.     Conversely, if you can keep going you haven’t lost. Apple was on the brink of disaster just over two decades ago. Yet the game kept playing and they wound up as the most valuable company in the world. At least for now.     Stamina is the central virtue in a world full of infinite games.       “You can’t always choose the path that you walk in life, but you can always choose the manner in which you walk it.” — John O’ Leary, On Fire       “Constantly scanning the world for the negative comes with a great cost. It undercuts our creativity, raises our stress levels, and lowers our motivation and ability to accomplish goals.” — Shawn Achor, the Happiness Advantage       A group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant’s body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience, and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest, and they come to blows.     The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people’s limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.       “The place to improve the world is first in one’s own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there.” — Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance       Do less, do what you do better, don’t get distracted along the way.       If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.       What matters is going out there and doing it, not thinking about it, not worrying what others might think, not even being attached to a result, just doing it. - Andy Puddicombe       There is a high chance that 50% of what we know is not true.     And the best part is that we don’t know which 50%.       Most people fool themselves by saying they’ll be happy once they have something or once a certain situation changes.     The truth is that your happiness doesn’t depend on things.     It depends on your inner world and your ability to focus on the things you’re grateful for, even when difficulties arise.       When people reflect on what it takes to be mentally fit, the first idea that comes to mind is usually intelligence. The smarter you are, the more complex the problems you can solve— and the faster you can solve them. Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.     Mental horsepower doesn’t guarantee mental dexterity. No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you’ll miss many occasions to think again. Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for ste­reotypes, because you’re faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs.     The curse of knowledge is that it closes your mind to what you don’t know. Good judgment depends on having the skill— and the will— to open your mind. A hallmark of wisdom is knowing when it’s time to abandon some of the most cherished parts of your identity.     — Adam Grant in Think Again       “At 20, you are constantly worrying about what other people think of you. At 40 you wake up and say, ‘I’m not going to give a damn what other people think anymore.’ And at 60 you realize no one is thinking about you at all.”     The most important piece of information there:  “Nobody is thinking about you from the very beginning.”   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   Happiness is not a consumable product. It is not something you find by searching for it. It is a naturally arising byproduct of a fulfilling, well-lived life.     A well-lived life has more to do with perspective than anything else. As long as you can laugh, there is hope.       There are big, hard-to-implement, habits. And then there are small, easy-to-implement, habits. I love both but it’s clear the latter ones are easier to add to our already (seemingly) busy life.     All things considered, they are also life-changing in the very long run. The only difficulty with those is how hidden their impact is. It’s easy to drop them because you don’t see how useful they are. Keep at them for long enough and your life will improve.     You can start changing your life. You can be happier with tiny changes. Hey, you can even start today.       One day you’ll wake up and shake your head and wonder where all that time went. Then you’ll ask “did I make the most of it?” And, with your whole heart, you’ll want the answer to be yes.     Do what you can now to get to yes.       It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, is poor.       “Anything that costs you your health, relationships, or happiness isn’t really a success.”          “Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit when you don’t know something, and to learn something new.”         Barack Obama         Quite often, we allow others to dictate how we should live and behave instead of listening to our deepest desires.     Answering the following questions might help you get closer to the person you want to be.     Who am I when I don’t follow others’ expectations?     Am I holding on to something I need to let go of?     What matters most in my life?     How do I want to live, knowing I will die?     Does it matter what others think about me?     What would I do if I knew I couldn’t fail?       “So long as an opinion is strongly rooted in the feelings, it gains rather than loses stability by having a preponderating weight of argument against it.” -John Mill     Our rationales are dangerously burdened by our emotions and sense of identity.     The lottery is a tax on people who can’t do the math. Arguing on the internet is a tax on people who don’t value their time.       Every human is a walking science experiment. We are composed of chemicals that swirl and change based on the thousands of decisions we make each day. When people act in reckless disregard for their chemical nature, it poisons any happiness initiative. They take up meditation but then they binge drink. They manage their work-life balance but stay in dysfunctional relationships. They eat healthy but stay up until 3 AM on their phone every night.     Avoid deal-breaker habits.       It might feel good at the moment to break the rules. But mark my words, there’s a sinking feeling that comes later on.     Be willing to say no when it is most difficult.       “The best fighter is never angry.” ― Lao Tzu          Most of us are so used to complaining and negative thinking that we don’t even realize how these habits are holding us back from living a great life.     But here’s the truth: The more you complain, the more negativity you’ll find.     We’re all human and it’s okay to experience negative situations and emotions, but we can always choose how we react to them.     And the reality is that you always have two choices: You can either complain about something or look for a solution.     If you can change the situation, do it.     If you can’t do anything about it, move on and focus on the next best thing.       You teach people how to treat you by showing them how you treat yourself.       In today’s fast-paced world, most people feel stressed before there’s anything to stress about. They’re so used to being overwhelmed that they don’t even expect their lives to be easy and enjoyable.     And that’s exactly the problem: You attract what you expect. If you expect difficulty, you’ll find it. If you expect beautiful experiences, your focus will shift and you’ll discover more of them.     And the reality is that most of our negative feelings are caused by a lack of mindfulness. You barely feel stressed about something that’s happening right now.          Social media can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how you choose to use it. It’s neither good nor bad, it’s just a tool and you can decide how to integrate it into your life.     Whatever you do, don’t allow it to mess up with your inner world. Instead, make sure you get to see what you want to see. If you’re careful about your usage, social media can indeed help you become a better and happier person.     And don’t forget that social media is just a TINY excerpt of reality.       The best response is often “You’re probably right.”     Nothing is gained by arguing with someone over something that doesn’t matter.       When it comes to making decisions, your environment matters. Just as it’s hard to eat healthy if your kitchen is full of junk food, it’s hard to make good decisions when you’re too busy to think. Just as the kitchen influences what you eat, your office/environment influences how you make decisions.     Most of us make decisions in an environment where it is very hard for us to behave rationally.       Leave it better than you found it. Just because you struggled doesn’t mean everyone needs to.     It can be anything: code, ideas, person.       We often talk about everything we have to do on a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.     Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.     You “get” to wake up early for work. You “get” to make another sales call for your business. You “get” to cook dinner for your family.       “You are a jigsaw puzzle piece of a certain shape. You could change your shape to fit an existing hole in the world. That was the traditional plan. But there’s another way that can often be better for you and for the world: to grow a new puzzle around you.”       Why do I get angry when I am insulted?     A: Because you entertain the verity of the insult.     -Kapil Gupta       “One lesson I’ve learned is that if the job I do were easy, I wouldn’t derive so much satisfaction from it. The thrill of winning is in direct proportion to the effort I put in before. I also know, from long experience, that if you make an effort in training when you don’t especially feel like making it, the payoff is that you will win games when you are not feeling your best. That is how you win championships, that is what separates the great player from the merely good player. The difference lies in how well you’ve prepared.”     — Rafael Nadal       In dwelling, live close to the ground.     In thinking, keep it to the simple.     In conflict, be fair and generous,     In governing, don’t try to control.     In work, do what you enjoy.     In family life, be completely present.     When you are content to be simply yourself     And don’t compare or compete,     Everybody will respect you.       It is hard to have a phone. I mean, yeah, it is also fun to have a phone, but you know how addicted you are to it. You realize that it is pulling you all the time. And when it pulls you, it sometimes tells you something that you don’t want to hear: You get a mean email from a friend or a conflict-y text or not enough people liked your Instagram post or someone thinks something is wrong with your Instagram post and has commented about it and their comment has gone semi-viral. Then you have to stop everything and deal with that. It is exhausting. It is a lot. If, right now, you can let yourself put your phone away for the next 90 minutes, that would be a gift you could give yourself.     You would be letting yourself be present.       The right solution is expensive. The wrong one costs a fortune.       In a society that is obsessed with hard work and career success,     seeking boredom is an act of rebellion.       The best way to change your entire life is by not changing your entire life. Instead, it is best to focus on one specific habit, work on it until you master it, and make it an automatic part of your daily life. Then, repeat the process for the next habit.     link       A big problem is just a bunch of small problems combined. Learn to separate them out.     It’s all a matter of approach.       “I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences. That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less energy they expend on your prose, the more they’ll have left for your ideas.” — Write Simply       “I don’t trust people who don’t love themselves and tell me ‘I love you.’ … There is an African saying which is: ‘Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt.’” — Maya Angelou       “[T]here’s just the status quo bias that naturally ensues from “well, we have a working system; that system naturally resists change”. The period of the early twentieth century was an era of building in the broadest sense, from universities to government agencies to cities to highways. The byproduct of this period of building is maintenance and we haven’t figured out how to meta-maintain – that is, how to avoid emergent sclerosis in the stuff we build. … The “enemy”, such as it is, is the calcification that follows from an existing install base. And all cultural questions aside, the US simply has a very large existing install base of aged institutions and systems.” — Patrick Collison   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   When you care more about getting things right than being right, you get better outcomes and you save time and energy.       “A year from now you will wish you had started today.” — Karen Lamb       In reality, addiction can form to just about anything. We attach moral reasoning to it after the fact. The key to solving addiction is to remove stigma and shame, not drown people in it.     People like to use their moral reasoning in order to inflict pain and suffering on everyone else. They see it as imperative to impose their own beliefs on others. They think by cleansing the world, then they’ll cleanse themselves.     Instead of focusing on their own actions and behaviours, they identify the root cause in something outside themselves — an exterior enemy that has to be eradicated in order for them to feel wholesome. They project this hate toward anyone who’s not like them.     In reality, they love sin.     They hate the sinner.       The fastest learners are young children because they don’t care what other people think about them. When they fall, they pull themselves right back up – hundreds of times – because they want to walk and don’t care who is watching them fall in the process. As we grow older, we are not only ashamed when we fall, we are afraid before we even try something new that someone will criticize us.     Learning is a lifelong process as we fall and pull ourselves up, sometimes hundreds of times. But like children who are determined to walk, we can keep uncovering the limiting beliefs that block us from moving forward and change them, one truth and one step at a time.       “The more I know - the more I know that I don’t know.” - Richard Feynman       Being bored takes courage.     Most of us would rather occupy ourselves with our phone, a book, or even the back of a cereal box rather than sit still with no distractions. But this reluctance to be alone with ourselves comes at a cost.     It means we may never discover what boredom actually is: a diving board into the deep end of our mind—and a gateway to something bigger and more profound.     The truth is, there are many astonishing insights waiting for us on the other side of boredom. But to access these insights, we first need to set aside our comforting distractions, if only for a moment at a time.       Being busy isn’t the same thing as adding value.       “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.” — H. L. Hunt       “If we see someone throwing money away, we call that person crazy. Money has value. Wasting it seems nuts. And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time.”     — The Shortness of Time       “The flaws you see in others are actually a reflection of yourself.” — Eve Branson     Coming to terms with this requires you to drop your ego and be humble, but when you do, you can get to the root of the trouble and start working on yourself.       “What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” — George Eliot       You see the world through your perspective, just as everyone else views it through theirs.     People often form assumptions about others’ behaviour based on their own. If they don’t trust others, chances are it’s because they know others can’t trust them.          Nowadays, a person who is listening without his phone and focuses on what you say with intentions — is a blessing. If we start to think about it is even depressing. How have we changed over time?     Few people are listeners because of their busy life. Nobody even has the necessity to talk and opt for scrolling their phones to check their social media instead. Finally, you make that choice to spend more time focusing on that rather than have a real interaction with a real person.     The person who cares for you is the person who is taking the time to listen and understand your needs.       “If I had an hour to save the world, I’d spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” - Einstein     The act of analyzing and examining assumptions is what makes solutions appear in plain sight.     Stay in search of the clearest definition of your life’s problems.          I’ve found that there is no running from who you are. When things don’t feel right, it reflects a lack of alignment in your life. Who you are and what you are doing is no longer compatible.     Time spent unhappy is an abject waste. Never stop searching for your true path. Even if you never find it, it’s better to die searching than to have never looked at all.       Don’t become a “spiritual person.”     There are many good reasons why a person might choose to meditate—the classic reason being to reduce psychological suffering. Paradoxically, this is accomplished not by trying to avoid or improve one’s experience, but by clearly observing how thoughts and emotions arise, proliferate, and become enshrined in behaviour.     Seeing the whole apparatus at work can be incredibly freeing.     So, seeking to get rid of suffering—whether it’s anxiety, fear, anger, or any other negative emotion—is what brings most people to the practice. And there’s nothing wrong with that starting point.     But there are some misguided reasons to practice meditation. And chief among them is seeking to become a spiritual person. To become a “good meditator.” It’s all too easy to grow more and more precious with your new spiritual ideas and beliefs, and to begin annoying everyone around you.     To be clear, the mistake isn’t in being excited about the benefits of meditation. It’s natural to feel good that you’re training your mind in this way, and to want to share your experience with others.     The mistake lies in forming a new identity out of spiritual life. And then failing to see it.          There is only one way to achieve any goal - fall in love with the journey. And when you reach the goal, you might realize that the journey was way more fun than winning the trophy.       If you are not going to have the courage to take the path you wish to take, despite what the world thinks of you, despite what the world tells you to do, despite all the obstacles that you can foresee, only because it makes you truly happy     No one is going to do it for you.       What society wants for you, may not always be good for you. Society is a large group. And groups search for consensus, individuals search for truth.     It is not acceptable for society to tell you the truth in many things. There are many things that society throws at you all day long, even if you are a smart and critical person, you just believe. But you may be forced and dive deep down, you will find that those are not true.          “I said: what about my eyes? He said: Keep them on the road.     I said: What about my passion? He said: Keep it burning.     I said: What about my heart? He said: Tell me what you hold inside it?     I said: Pain and sorrow. He said: Stay with it. The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” ― Attributed to Rumi       Our lives aren’t measured by how many people inspire us, but rather how many people we inspire. Just do yourself a favour and don’t overthink what and how you can begin to best support your target.     If I’ve learned anything in life, it’s that big gestures aren’t always what leads to people’s breakthroughs. In fact, for me personally, it was “little” words and actions from people whom I respected that ultimately sparked my fight.       Figuring out what you want to do with your life is a massive question. It’s easy to understand why people feel like they’re behind, as social media paints a picture that everyone is living their best lives but us.     But I don’t know about you, I’d rather support someone’s uncurated picture of them giving training to a group of kids over them talking about how warm the water is in Barbados.     So if you want to be truly rich, don’t get distracted by the big noise — and instead, go small by getting clear on what you can do with what you have to positively impact the people in front of you.       Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief.     A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others. This is what everyone throughout the world is attempting to do. Truth is narrowed down and made a plaything for those who are weak, for those who are only momentarily discontented.     Truth cannot be brought down, rather the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountain-top to the valley. If you would attain to the mountain-top you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.       Become more comfortable with being bored. Instead of grabbing your smartphone whenever you have nothing to do, just allow yourself to be bored and present at the moment.     By being present in the moment you train your mind to focus, contrasted with the distracted mindset you foster when constantly distracting yourself with the torrent of information available on social media and the like.       The world is designed to make our lives comfortable. So it tricks us into believing that life’s purpose is to chase comfort.     And therein lies the contradiction.     Avoiding the comfort trap is the difference between who you are and who you could have been.       “Like our stomachs, our minds are hurt more often by overeating than by hunger.”   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.     His procedure was simple: on the final day of class, he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.     Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.          Meditation is not engaging in some pleasant or interesting experience in order to generate positive feelings. It’s not about tuning out the world and coming to a place of inner peace.     True meditation is the ability to recognize what your mind is like, prior to being lost in thought. When you’re engaged in meditation, you’re no longer identifying with every thought, reaction, whim, or emotion that comes barreling into your mind.     However, once you know how to practice, it is true to say that any activity can be synonymous with meditation. You can recognize the nature of your mind at any point, in any location, under any circumstance. But this must first be practised in formal sessions.     So, yes. You can meditate while hiking, running, biking or doing anything else a human being can do. But only after you know how to practice.       We all know people who behave very differently depending on who they’re around. Someone who’s polite, deferential, and accommodating with their grandmother can morph into a jerk when speaking with a customer service agent.     Now, it’s easy to judge these people as being two-faced or disingenuous. But it’s instructive to notice that we’re all in this situation to varying degrees.     For instance, who we are on a Zoom call with a client likely feels different than whom we are when speaking with a family member or friend.     The core of whom we take ourselves to seem to remain intact, yet the face we wear seems to change, whether subtly or dramatically. It’s as if we have a collection of masks that we reflexively put on, depending on who’s in front of us.     As you go about your day today, notice how your sense of self changes depending on whom you interact with. Notice the mask you’re wearing in each interaction.     And realize that it’s not who you really are.       What’s something that looks way riskier than it actually is?     Here’s my answer: Asking. For anything!     I would love to know your thoughts.        If you tolerate too much half-heartedness, it’s probably because you’re half-hearted. As in: anxious and ambivalent, looking for reassurance. As in: bored, along for the ride, not really sure about your own feelings and opinions. As in: external locus of control vs internal locus of control. You probably don’t have anything in your life that really tethers you to yourself—you don’t have conviction about what you love, so you’re hoping that someone else will provide you that certainty.     I think that people come alive when they’re serious about what they love—when they choose to pay careful attention to what feeds and sustains them.       “Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.” — Plato       When I say I don’t like your idea, I’m not saying that I don’t like you. And if we’ve been persuaded by marketers and politicians that everything we do and say is our identity, then it gets very difficult to learn, to accept useful feedback and to change. Evolving our choices and our tastes is part of being human. Establishing your identity as someone who is not static, open to change and eager for better makes it far easier to engage in a world where some would prefer us to do precisely the opposite.          We love the idea of being good at something. We deck out our equipment. But then we contend with reality: the idea of being a rockstar is more fun than practising scales for hours every day.     It’s demoralizing to be bad at something, particularly over long stretches of time. People forget that mastery isn’t a linear progression.     Don’t settle for the idea that you have no talent for most things. Schools do a great job labelling us with all sorts of test scores and suggestions of our respective value to society.     There’s a popular phrase by Tim Notke that always felt unfinished. It reads, “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” The phrase that should be added, “And talent doesn’t usually work hard.” Humans can be shockingly lazy, a collective ocean of lost potential.     You generally have much more potential than you give yourself credit for. You just haven’t thought about something and practised it in the right way. Stay consistent and stubbornly glued to the idea of improvement. You’ll surprise yourself — and others.       “We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable … be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical—in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.     You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it … Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.” — Jeff Bezos 2020 Letter to Shareholders       Unless you are running a fire force, ambulance, or police, if you are working at 4 am, there is a 90% chance that you have mismanaged things in the day.     The solution is to use your day thoughtfully instead of running around distractedly, submerged in non-stop emails, meetings, and calls.     Instead of slogging at night, fix your day.          You may not believe your life is anything special, but take a moment to think of the millions of people in the world who would happily trade places with you if they only could.     Think of the people currently caught in a war zone. Think of those who must walk miles for clean water. Think of the millions whose daily ration of food is less than what you ate for lunch.     Despite all the things you wish you could fix or improve in your life, the truth is this: If you have the leisure to read this right now, you’re most likely living some version of “the dream life.”     Wake up and see for yourself.       “Beethoven became more original and brilliant as a composer in inverse proportion to his ability to hear his own — and others’ — music. But maybe it isn’t so surprising. As his hearing deteriorated, he was less influenced by the prevailing compositional fashions, and more by the musical structures forming inside his own head.     His early work is pleasantly reminiscent of his early instructor, the hugely popular Josef Haydn. Beethoven’s later work became so original that he was, and is, regarded as the father of music’s romantic period. … Deafness freed Beethoven as a composer because he no longer had society’s soundtrack in his ears..”         You’re free when no one can buy your time.       “All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.”     “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”     “If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters — don’t wish to seem knowledgeable. And if some regard you as important, distrust yourself.”     “Control your perceptions. Direct your actions properly. Willingly accept what’s outside your control.”     “You must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control.”     “If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.”     -Ryan       “Man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild.”     “A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.”     “Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armory of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace. By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master.”     “Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry”     “The outer conditions of a person’s life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state…Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are.”     -James Allen       Your contentment and happiness is a state of mind. What may be enough for you may not be enough for somebody else, but how will that help? The lack mindset will always make you feel that you’re in a state of lack, no matter how much you earn.     The abundance mindset can make you realise that there isn’t a deadly competition but there’s space for all of you to succeed. What you produce is what no one else can, it’s what makes you unique. Your Big-Why will get you to your table each day to produce.     Don’t focus too much on the metrics of stats of money, they seldom move by just staring but move by doing. Create, instead.       You are defined by not just the things that you see/experience.     You are defined by all the things that you will never see/experience.       The quickest to be offended are the easiest to manipulate.         Real spirituality is not about being a Hindu or Christian or a Muslim or a Jew …. or anything else.     It’s about cleansing our heart.     It is about awakening the dormant love of God within us and being instruments of that compassion in our lives, in whatever we may do.       “You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, ‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!” ~ Richard Feynman     How can I…     Contribute to humanity’s important problems rather than taking the path of least resistance?     Leverage the unique knowledge and skills of those around me and galvanize them towards a worthy and desirable purpose?     Codify the universal principles of personal effectiveness and peak performance?     Develop a holistic model of what it means to be human?     Spend more time on the frontiers and in the deep water where the undiscovered and unsynthesized knowledge lives?     Harvest my subconscious for unique insights rather than repackaging the ideas and beliefs of others, planting trees for the next generation rather than just picking them?     Subvert my ego to share ideas in a way that induces self-reflection and behavioral change rather than resistance? (i.e. being empathetic about the problem rather than insistent upon my solution.)     Reduce my time spent making trivial decisions to improve my speed of implementation?     Develop the focus, discipline, and environment to make action my default state of being?     Avoid the traps of the hedonic treadmill (status signaling, over-consumption, pleasure-seeking behavior)?     Go to bed every night satisfied and wake up every day like it is Christmas morning?     Overcome fears and self-doubt in order to live an authentic and meaningful life?       “Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted.”     “One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.”     “Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‘we’ and ‘they’.”     “Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.”     – Sapiens       “If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.”     “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.”     “Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.”     “The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.”     “Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull. ”     –1984        “Man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild.”     “A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.”     “Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry”     “The outer conditions of a person’s life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state…Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are.”     –As a Man Thinketh       “All I know is this: nobody’s very big in the first place, and it looks to me like everybody spends their whole life tearing everybody else down.”     “That ain’t me, that ain’t my face. It wasn’t even me when I was trying to be that face. I wasn’t even really me them; I was just being the way I looked, the way people wanted.”     “If you don’t watch it people will force you one way or the other, into doing what they think you should do, or into just being mule-stubborn and doing the opposite out of spite.”     “You had a choice: you could either strain and look at things that appeared in front of you in the fog, painful as it might be, or you could relax and lose yourself”     –One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest       “It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime…”     “There is only one sin. and that is theft… when you tell a lie, you steal someones right to the truth. When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife’s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness.”     “I’m so afraid. Because I’m so profoundly happy. Happiness like this is frightening…They only let you this happy if they’re preparing to take something from you.”     – The Kite runner          “To fight the good fight is one of the bravest and noblest of life’s experiences. Not the bloodshed and the battle of a man with man, but the grappling with mental and spiritual adversaries that determines the inner calibre of the contestant. It is the quality of the struggle put forth by a man that proclaims to the world what manner of man he is far more than maybe by the termination of the battle.     It matters not nearly so much to a man that he succeeds in winning some long-sought prize as it does that he has worked for it honestly and unfalteringly with all the force and energy there is in him. It is in the effort that the soul grows and asserts itself to the fullest extent of its possibilities, and he that has worked will, persevering in the face of all opposition and apparent failure, fairly and squarely endeavouring to perform his part to the utmost extent of his capabilities, may well look back upon his labour regardless of any seeming defeat in its result and say, ‘I have fought a good fight.’     As you throw the weight of your influence on the side of the good, the true and the beautiful, your life will achieve endless splendour. It will continue in the lives of others, higher, finer, nobler than you can even contemplate.” — Hugh B. Brown       “We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.”     “It’s not given to people to judge what’s right or wrong. People have eternally been mistaken and will be mistaken, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.”     “What is the cause of historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person. On what condition are the wills of the masses transferred to one person? On condition that the person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is power. That is, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand. ”     “A man on a thousand-mile walk has to forget his goal and say to himself every morning, ‘Today I’m going to cover twenty-five miles and then rest up and sleep.”     –War and Peace       In a sermon delivered at the height of World War Two, a period awash in distraction and despair, C.S. Lewis delivered a powerful claim about the cultivation of a deep life:     “We are always falling in love or quarrelling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavourable. Favourable conditions never come.”     We all face distractions from the deeper efforts we know are important: the confrontation of something not going right in our lives; an important idea that needs development; more time with those who matter most. But we delay and divert. It’s easier to yell at someone for doing something wrong than to yell in pride about something we did right. It’s easier to seek amusement than to pursue something moving.     At some point, however, there’s nothing left but to embrace Lewis’s call to “get down to our work,” even if the favourable conditions never come.       “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.”     — Steve Jobs    ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   The best way to improve your ability to think is to spend time thinking. Most of us are too busy to think. We have too many meetings. Too many calls. Too many priorities. Too many demands on our time. With no time to think and make good decisions we rush and make bad ones.     And because we made bad decisions, our precious time is further strained as we correct our previous decisions.       If you choose not to react because you value your inner peace a lot more than winning an argument,     it’s called wisdom and not lack of confidence.       Not everyone who tells you that you are wrong, are people you should avoid.     There are people who tell you that you are wrong. There are people that help you see where you are wrong.     The latter are precious. Hunt for them. Embrace them. They are the ones we all need.     Reach out to someone who has played that role in your life.       A huge step in life is when you start questioning things. We are taught so many things that are untrue. The next step is becoming able to reject lies and live in a more honest way. The hardest part is when you do that well, you find yourself very alone because so few people challenge the illusion. It’s not easy to walk that path, but evolution requires hard work.     All you can do is live the best you know how. Maybe that can help other people… Either way, I believe everyone has to find the next step forward in their own way. I don’t think anyone can do it for you. But it does help to have examples.       “You can’t outrun your pain. You are strong enough to face whatever is in front of you. Medicating your pain will only bring more pain. The only genuine shortcut life offers is facing your feelings. They won’t kill you. Feelings are your soul’s way of communicating. Pain is trying to teach you something, and if you don’t listen now, it will speak louder and louder until it is heard.” — Jewel in Never Broken       The cost of making decisions to please others instead of yourself is misery.       Vegetarian Lion: “Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you’re a good person is like expecting a lion not to attack you because you’re a vegetarian.”     Mighty Mosquito: “If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.” — the Dalai Lama     Checkmate Pigeons: “Don’t play chess with a pigeon. It’ll just knock over the pieces, shit all over the board and then strut around like it won the game.”       Apple Exchange: “If I have an apple and you have an apple and we exchange them, we both still have one apple. However, if I have an idea and you also have an idea and we exchange them, we both have two ideas.”     “Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. So, switch off the pulsating TV/radio/online news, you will feel better.”       “If someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom. Yet, how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you. When you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master.” -Epictetus.       Pans and Pots: the mind is not an earthen pot to be filled, it’s a fire to be kindled — kindle it with kindness for yourself first.     Backpack: A backpack is more than enough for your most important belongings. Everything else is excess baggage.       Smart Children: If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for ten years, plant trees. If your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.     Yourself: When you decide that you look great the way you are, the world has lost 90% of its power over you.          “Many people spend their whole lives struggling to escape from a dream prison, rather than simply waking up.” —Sam Harris     Meditation can radically transform your sense of what life is all about—and can lead to a greater sense of freedom and well-being in every moment.     But no one can make these discoveries for you. Instead, you must experience them for yourself.       Accumulating knowledge doesn’t always lead to independent thought. We all can point to instances of groupthink, where the more people discuss, the more they form a consensus that turns out to be wrong.     Schooling is often just as much about obedience as it is about learning. We teach the scientific method, but mostly in the same way as religious scriptures—facts brought to us by authority, rather than truths discovered through experience.     In both cases, the problems of conformity and false consensus are solved by more learning. As you encounter more ideas and arguments, you start to spot the holes in foundations that previously felt unassailable. Reading a single book makes you feel that the author has it all figured out. Reading a dozen quickly shows that he doesn’t.     If you want to think for yourself, the only path forward is to learn more. Not just from those who have the same opinions you do, but from everyone who disagrees. And not just the average person who disagrees, but the smartest people who object.       Whether it is food or other comforts, the human body needs only so much. In the name of living better and luxury, we keep wanting and buying more – it doesn’t work; we only lose our health and peace of mind.     Beyond a point, consuming more only makes us unhappier and die sooner.     Try consuming less.       “Now that your worry has proved such an unlucrative business/ Why not find a better job?” ― Hafiz       Ironically, aversion to failure results in life’s biggest failure – you don’t learn.     Much better to keep failing and learning, even if it creates a messy resume.     Life is bigger than a resume.       “The risk of becoming too steeped in any one framework is you start to be “subject” to that framework, you can only look through its lens, not at the lens. I recommend trying to hold a handful of frameworks in your mind simultaneously in order to maintain flexibility.”       “An ignorant mind is precisely not a spotless, empty vessel, but one that’s filled with the clutter of irrelevant or misleading life experiences, theories, facts, intuitions, strategies, algorithms, heuristics, metaphors, and hunches that regrettably have the look and feel of useful and accurate knowledge. This clutter is an unfortunate by-product of one of our greatest strengths as a species. We are unbridled pattern recognizers and profligate theorizers. Often, our theories are good enough to get us through the day, or at least to an age when we can procreate. But our genius for creative storytelling, combined with our inability to detect our own ignorance, can sometimes lead to situations that are embarrassing, unfortunate, or downright dangerous—especially in a technologically advanced, complex democratic society that occasionally invests mistaken popular beliefs with immense destructive power.”     — David Dunning          Do we accept the pain or reject it?     The first choice is accepting the pain because I know in the long run it’s going to help me learn. I’m going to go in and I’m going to examine my decisions. I’m going to see where maybe I could’ve improved, where I could’ve made a better decision that would’ve increased the likelihood that I had a better outcome. The short term is going to take a hit but in the long run, I’m going to feel better about myself and I’ll obviously have a more positive narrative of my life story over the long run if I’m willing to do that.     The second choice is avoiding the pain. People make this choice when they don’t want to face reality… when they want to preserve their self-narrative. They don’t want to take the hit so I’m going to blame it on luck. In the short run, that feels good, because you don’t need to do any kind of identity update. You don’t need to admit you were wrong. You don’t need to update your beliefs in any kind of way or say that those beliefs were wrong, or that you made poor choices, or that you caused these things to happen, but it’s devastating to learning. It’s devastating to long term results.     –Annie Duke       What seems like a difference in talent often comes down to a difference in focus.     Focus turns good performers into great performers.     Two keys to focus are saying no to distractions and working on the same problem for an uncommonly long time.     Both are simple but not easy.       The following quote from Epictetus is around 2000 years old. But it seems like it’s about today’s world:  “Most of what passes for legitimate entertainment is inferior or foolish and only caters to or exploits people’s weakness.”     I want to control my attention as much as I can. Why? Because If I don’t, millions of people and organizations are eager to control it for me. And what happens when others control your attention? You become a mindless drone.       Most people acquire a lot of information but not a lot of knowledge. That’s because it’s easy to obtain information. But acquiring knowledge takes time.     For example, reading a book or taking a course is a serious time investment that requires an actual decision. You actually think to yourself, “Is this worth my time?” Or at least, that’s something I think everyone needs to ask themselves.     But you don’t ask that when you grab your phone to consume random information. You’re thinking, “It’s just a social media post, a short video, an article,” and so forth. But the problem is that you go down a rabbit hole. And you end up consuming a lot of information. But most of it serves no purpose.     When you acquire knowledge, you do it with intention and a specific focus.       I think the future belongs to people who are what I call meta-rational. That is, people who realize their own limitations. So not all the skills that you think are so valuable actually will matter in the future. Don’t just feel good about yourself, but think critically, what am I actually good at that will complement emerging sectors and emerging technologies.     The world of the future, even the present will be a world of algorithms. … People who think they can beat the algorithms will make a lot more mistakes. … So know when you should defer. It’s easier than ever before to get advice from other people, including on podcasts, right? Or, you know, go to Yelp. When can you trust the advice of others? Having good judgment there is becoming more important than just being the smartest person or having the highest IQ.       Why walk when you can still run?     I’m all for accepting yourself — and the life stage you’re at — but I believe the secret of youth is in the stretch, physically and mentally. Spiritually too, if you like. In growing and learning, and in making life slightly hard for yourself.     You can’t arrest time and you (often) can’t control circumstance, but you can leave your comfort zone. You can set hard(ish) goals and do different things. You can keep trying. You can, at the very least, not close down your spirit/mind too soon.     It’s important that strive to do ALL we are capable of — not necessarily all at once — but that we continue to do what we can do until we can’t.  Because that day will come, too.     So what are you making too easy for yourself?     Because: Why sit when you can still walk?       There are two types of talent: natural and chosen.     Natural talent needs no explanation. Some people are just born better at certain things than others. While natural talent may win in the short term, it rarely wins in the long term. A lot of people who are naturally talented don’t develop work at getting better.     Eventually, naturally talented people are passed by people who choose talent.     How can you choose talent?     When you focus all of your energy in one direction for an uncommonly long period of time, you develop talent.     Results follow obsession.       Drink water from the spring where horse drink. The horse will never drink bad water. Lay your bed where the cat sleeps. Eat the fruit touched by a worm.boldly pick the mushrooms on which the insect sit.plant the tree where the mole digs. Build your house where the snakes sits to warm itself. Dig your fountain where the birds hide from heat. Goto sleep and wake up at the same time with the birds. - you will reap all of the golden days grains. Eat more green - you will have strong legs and strong resistance heart,like the beings of the forest. Swim often and you will feel on earth like fish in the water. Look at the sky as often as possible and your thoughts will become light and clear. Be quite a lot, speak little and the silence will come in your heart, and your spirit will be calm and full of peace ✌️.     Saint Seraphim of Sarov       The recipe for doing hard things:          Get started     Don’t quit       Whether trying to build a habit, run a marathon, or master a skill, we keep reading quintals of books and binge-watch self-improvement videos like a Netflix series. Not needed.     Reading one book or watching 2-3 videos was probably ok. But after that, it was just procrastination.     Get started. Once you start, it will get done.     Sometimes, knowledge is not power, action is power.       “Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is a quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’” — Mary Anne Radmacher       In life, you don’t need to know the answers to all the questions. But don’t try to lie that you do.     Anyone worth partnering with can spot an amateur liar.     Professional liars have a tell. They always need to find a new person to fool because the people they’ve duped in the past don’t want to work with them again. This is why a professional liar almost never succeeds on a large scale.     If you don’t know, just say you don’t know and you’ll figure it out. Don’t fake it till you make it. Work until you get it.   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   We rarely do or say something intentionally that surprises us. That’s because we are in intimate contact with the noise in our heads–we spend our days looking in the mirror, listening to our inner voice and defining our point of view. “That’s not the sort of thing I would say or do…”     If our ideas are equated to our identity, then talking about ideas is very much the act of talking about yourself.     As the media realizes that they can improve profits by narrowcasting ideas to people who embrace them as part of who they are, it gets increasingly difficult to have a constructive conversation about many ideas–because while people are able and sometimes eager to change some of their less personal ideas, we rarely seek to change our identity.     It doesn’t have to be this way.     The most successful problem solvers are people who have embraced this simple method–your current idea isn’t your identity, it’s simply a step closer to a solution to the problem in front of you.       5 Buddhist concepts:     Anatman: Let go of your ego. Stop chasing fame, likes on social media, and other empty things.     Shila: Don’t engage in actions because they are good for you. Do them because they are the right thing to do.     Prajna: Study how the world works, and act according to that knowledge.     Karuna: Feel compassion towards others, help them when they are down, and help them even if they are up.     Mudita: Enjoy the little things. Be happy for others.       “You’re entitled to your own opinion if you keep your opinion to yourself. If you decide to say it out loud, then I think you have a responsibility to be open to changing your mind in the face of better logic or stronger data. I think if you’re willing to voice an opinion, you should also be willing to change that opinion.”     — Adam Grant       “You don’t just reciprocate affection, you reciprocate animosity, and the whole thing can escalate.”     — Charlie Munger       Wealth is having a small ego. Wealth is strong family bonds. Wealth is what you already have. Wealth is helping people get what they want. Wealth is what you put back into the stream of human consciousness.     How you think about wealth, creates wealth.       Buying a Lambo doesn’t make you cool.     Setting up a fund to help struggling small businesses/a non-profit, is the real definition of cool. Using money to solve societal issues bigger than yourself is a way to take the concept of money and change human consciousness.     You’ll teleport out of your own selfish prison into a whole new world. You’ll have a different reason to wake up in the morning. The suffering of others will become part of your suffering.     Using money to transcend yourself is the meaning of money you can take away from financially super smart people.       A cluttered mind cannot focus. Or, rather, such a mind can attend but not be at the height of its focus. I came across research[1] showing that a calmer mind, trained by breathing and other exercises, will allow soldiers to make better decisions in battle, including about when to pull the trigger amid the chaos of urban combat.     If calming down the mind can be a powerful tool for focus in times of both war and peace — in other words, in the full spectrum of the human condition — then surely it can work in your day-to-day.     Not, though, if you’re exhausted.     URL       To virtually everyone who isn’t you, your focus is a commodity. It is being amassed, collected, repackaged and sold en masse. This makes your attention extremely valuable in aggregate. Collectively, audiences are worth a whole lot. But individually, your attention and my attention don’t mean anything to the eyeball aggregators. It’s a drop in their growing ocean. It’s essentially nothing.     To you, though, it is everything. In your own life, it is the difference between achievement and failure, driving and crashing, a romantic dinner and a disastrous date, looking back on a life spent with intention and one spent being pulled apart.     This mismatch, between the way they value your attention and the way you should value your attention, is a disconnect at the core of many of our lives. It’s a commodity to them, and priceless to you. The first step in protecting your focus, it may go without saying, is ridding yourself of the external distraction.     And finally, you have to rid yourself of internal distraction.       We all live in chaos. And our response mostly is, ‘Do more.’     Wrong. Often, the better answer is – ‘Pause and reflect.’     Every day, try writing down your thoughts, worries, and fears on paper. Talk to yourself. This is not some woo-woo idea, it is research-backed, and has helped people a lot.     When in a storm, we need clarity, not random action – don’t be an unguided missile.       “The biggest fear most of us have with learning to say NO is that we will miss an opportunity. An opportunity that would have catapulted us to success, or that will never come again. And most of the time, that simply isn’t true. I’ve found that the first part of learning to say NO is learning to accept that offers and opportunities are merely an indication that you’re on the right path- not that you’ve arrived at a final destination you can never find again.’” — Grace Bonney       “I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.”     — Sherlock Holmes       Waiting for the right time is seductive. Our mind tricks us into thinking that waiting is actually doing something.     It’s easy to land in a state where you’re always waiting … for the right moment, for things to be perfect, for everything to feel just right. It’s easy to convince yourself that you’re not ready and if you wait for just a little longer then things will be easier.     Waiting rarely makes things easier. Most of the time, waiting makes things harder.     The right time is now.       Just beyond yourself.     It’s where you need to be.     Half a step into self-forgetting and the rest restored by what you’ll meet.     There is a road always beckoning.     –Just Beyond Yourself by David Whyte       “When you blame others for your negative feelings, you are being ignorant. When you blame yourself for your negative feelings, you are making progress. You are being wise when you stop blaming yourself or others.” - Epictetus       Keeping up with the Jones’s has always been a sign of insecurity. But with social media and technology, we have gone off the rails. That episode of Black Mirror where the woman destroys her life trying to get a better ‘rating’ is closer to reality than fiction.     It’s a daunting task, but confident and secure people lack the need to get validation from the digital world. Social media companies play on our need for validation and literally program our behaviour. And it works.     “79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” –Nir Eyal     Again, this is tough. We were once nomadic hunters scared of rejection for fear of being left alone to fend for ourselves. We have that same wiring now, but it drives us to post pictures of our vacations, ‘thirst traps’, our cars and homes, status updates about how cool our lives are, filtered and curated versions of our lives.     You have to strike a balance with this.     Sharing those accomplishments and giving people a window into your life makes you feel good, too. And there’s nothing wrong with it in and of itself. Just be careful. Find balance.       “The game is not about becoming somebody, it’s about becoming nobody.”     “The resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering.”     “The spiritual journey is individual, highly personal. It can’t be organized or regulated. It isn’t true that everyone should follow one path. Listen to your own truth.”     “I would like my life to be a statement of love and compassion — and where it isn’t, that’s where my work lies.”     “The quieter you become, the more you can hear.”     – Ram Dass       “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.” – MARK TWAIN     A lie is defined as an intentionally false statement. Statistics are a special kind of false statement. We’re speaking of a kind of unwitting chicanery: interpreting and promulgating statistics in a manner that often exaggerates associations, making things appear more meaningful than they are. The statistic may be more damaging in this respect.     The statistic allows one to be truthful, but at the risk of fooling other people, and perhaps more importantly, fooling oneself. “Figures often beguile me,” wrote Twain in his autobiography, “particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: ‘There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.’”       Unfortunately, the kind of self-criticism and scepticism necessary to mitigate foolishness (i.e., bending over backwards to communicate all of the ways in which the findings could be wrong) is virtually absent at every level: the “scientists,” peer review, the scientific journals, the media, and “the laymen.”  It’s too damn hard to always think critically—and we are not wired to do it as humans—but we must always strive for it.          Whether we like it or not, it’s more helpful to be “difficult” people when judging the merits of an argument or hypothesis—even (especially) when it’s our own. It behoves us to understand the difference between relative risk and absolute risk—and to always report both to provide context.        URL       What am I?  Where am I? When am I? What’s going to happen next?     Instead of trying to answer with your rational thinking mind, look underneath your concepts and language, and into the details of your own experience. Resist the urge to stay on the edge of your mind, satisfied with the same old stories and thoughts. Instead, plunge directly into the mystery of your being.     What is an experience made of? Where is my mind? What is this?     Learn to be a living question, and you’ll eventually find the answer you’re looking for.       One of the biggest keys to success at anything hard is believing that you can figure it out as you go along. A lot of people won’t start until they figure it out. And because most hard things can’t be figured out in advance, they never start.       If success is not making your life easier — or at least, providing you more autonomy — what good is it?          Just because someone you don’t respect holds a certain position doesn’t mean that position is incorrect. And vice versa. One of the toughest things to do in this life is to think for yourself, to come up with your own judgments on issues, stripped of bias or preconceived notions.       Opportunities to learn complementary skills are so abundant that we literary have no excuse to improve our minds and become better versions of ourselves.     You can put your digital screen to good use in your free time or downtime by learning something new. You can learn new knowledge on-demand, at any time of the day and anywhere.     Make no mistake, there are also tools that can waste all your downtime. Beware of your digital distractions. Your free or gap time might be the perfect time to learn valuable things, skills, or timeless knowledge.     Whatever your goal, there are tools that can help you build the smartest engine to achieve it without formal education.       If you ONLY read things you totally agree with, you’re reading the wrong stuff.        Wisdom is understanding that you don’t have to hold your happiness for Ransom. Until some future time, when all your problems are solved; when your to-do list is finally empty; when your desires get gratified; when your health is perfect; when all the news is good.     whatever your goals in life the quality of the journey have to become more important in reaching your destination. You have spent your entire life seeking to arrive at someplace.     What if this is it? Well, actually THIS IS IT.       “Studies have shown that 90% of error in thinking is due to error in perception. If you can change your perception, you can change your emotion and this can lead to new ideas. Logic will never change emotion or perception.”     URL          “People prefer their sources of information to be highly correlated. Then all the messages you get are consistent with each other and you’re comfortable.”     — Daniel Kahneman       We obsess about things we don’t have, but take for granted what we do.     What we forget is that someone out there would feel blessed to have the life we take for granted.   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   Nothing will change your future trajectory like your habits. While goals rely on extrinsic motivation, habits, once formed, are automatic. They literally rewire our brains.       No matter what obstacles you face, you first need to get deep with knowing yourself — your strengths, your values, your comfort zones, your blind spots, and your biases.     When you fully understand yourself, you’ll know where your true north lies.       “Sociopolitical forces today can make humility feel especially dangerous and even foolish. Social media has stunted our ability to reinvent our thinking because our ideas are increasingly cumulative: Every opinion we’ve ever posted online is memorialized. With such a well-documented history of beliefs, changing your mind on something important or controversial can feel like a weakness and open you up to public criticism. The solution to this is to take most of your opinions off the electronic grid.”       “People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.”         Donald Knuth         Sometimes, we believe that the strength of our ideas, arguments, or communication makes people change their minds. Wrong. People make up their own minds.     An effective way to convince and help people decide is the Socratic method. Instead of telling people how to think, or what to do, ask questions that will make them think about it. Once they think about it, they’ll care about it. And once they care about it, they’ll act on it.          “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” — John Maynard Keynes       “Scientists who study the mechanics of curiosity are finding that it is, at its core, a kind of probability algorithm—our brain’s continuous calculation of which path or action is likely to gain us the most knowledge in the least amount of time. Like the links on a Wikipedia page, curiosity builds upon itself, every question leading to the next. And as with a journey down the Wikipedia wormhole, where you start dictates where you might end up. That’s the funny thing about curiosity: It’s less about what you don’t know than about what you already do.”     URL       Meditation doesn’t stop as soon as you get up from your seat. Instead, every second of life is an opportunity to recognize the openness and clarity of your mind.     Take walking, for instance. Each step is a chance to be fully present, right now, no matter where you’re going. Notice how your balance shifts as you move. Notice the sights and sounds around you. Notice that your body knows exactly how to walk, without any conscious effort from you.     There really is no reason to rush through the world. And if you must rush for brief periods of time, why not do so mindfully?       Confirmation bias is the tendency to confirm what you already believe to be true while discarding any evidence that contradicts your beliefs.     We attribute confirmation bias to the people we disagree with and not ourselves.     We both think our view of the world is the correct one because it’s…ours.     If you want to be wise, figure out whether your biases and belief systems are helping you. If your beliefs aren’t helping you get the results you want, maybe you should change them.       If someone has an answer or solution to every complex macro problem, they’re not wise because they can’t resist the urge to have an opinion on something.     Wise people can say “I don’t know” and admit which areas of understanding are above their paygrade.     Wise people would never actually call themselves ‘wise.’ You can be confident in your intelligence, but you can also remember that you’re not as much of a hotshot as you think you are.       If you can’t get what you want from life, how smart are you, really?     What use is your ‘ intelligence’ if you can’t find happiness, meaning, and purpose?     Wisdom comes from that process of banging your head against the wall trying to get what you want, failing over and over again, until you finally get it. Many intelligent people are scared of going through this journey.       Privilege makes you think you know everything.     Wisdom reminds you that you know nothing.     When you know nothing, anything is possible.          You have more power and influence than you think. For instance, this year you could save at least one human life. Possibly many more. All it takes is just one moment of clarity—and a single decision to do good.     The whole world is waiting for you to become a moral hero. Will you answer the call?       Worry is preposterous; we don’t know enough to worry.     Nature is not mute; it is the man who is deaf.       Don’t try too hard to make your life easy.     “Strangely, life gets harder when you try to make it easy. Exercising might be hard, but never moving makes life harder. Uncomfortable conversations are hard, but avoiding every conflict is harder. Mastering your craft is hard, but having no skills is harder. Easy has a cost.”     -James Clear       Wherever you are right now, pause and look around you.     Feel your feet on the ground. Feel the texture of the phone in your hand. Hear the sounds, near and far. Relax your eyes, open your peripheral vision, and receive light from the visual field.     Marvel at the complexity and intricacy of everything happening on it’s own. And let this next breath come as it will, with no effort from you, as if you were being breathed.     You’re here. You’re alive. This is it. What more is there to be grateful for?       “For the classics, philosophical insight was the product of a life of leisure; for me, a life of leisure is the product of philosophical insight.”     — Nassim Nicholas Taleb       When you assume that something is impossible, sometimes it is just that you haven’t met the guy who has already done that.     Whenever your mind says, “I can’t do this,” – challenge it. It may just be an assumption.     You can do a lot more than you think you can. The obstacle, it turns out, is almost always inside your head.       Sometimes, it’s hard to make decisions at the moment. You know what you want to do but you end up doing something else. You walked into dinner with your friends telling yourself that you weren’t going to eat dessert and you walked out having devoured it. There is a way to make this easier.     Pre-decide what you want to do and make it an automatic rule.        Words are easy to say and hard to do.     While your words are how you see yourself, your actions are how other people see you.       “Ambition is a word that lacks ambition: ambition is frozen desire, the current of a vocational life immobilized and over-concretized to set, unforgiving goals. Ambition may be essential for the young but becomes the essential obstacle of any mature life…”          Consolations by David Whyte         In life, we are often too quick to judge. The truth is, we don’t know what will be good or bad for us.     Don’t worry about luck – you don’t control it. But here is what we do control – doing the best work we can.     Keep doing that and one day, luck will come around.       “A writer—and, I believe, generally all persons—must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource. All things have been given to us for a purpose, and an artist must feel this more intensely. All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.”     — Jorge Luis Borges       “Good thinkers understand a simple truth: you can’t make good decisions without good thinking and good thinking requires time. If you want to think better, schedule time to think and hone your understanding of the problem.”       “Things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing. We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don’t really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart again. It’s just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy. When we think that something is going to bring us pleasure, we don’t know what’s really going to happen. When we think something is going to give us misery, we don’t know. Letting there be room for not knowing is the most important thing of all.”       Ninety percent of success can be boiled down to consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself that you’re smarter than you are.       There will always be far more beyond the boundaries of our knowledge than within them. For some, this may be a rather depressing realization, because it means that, however much we strive to expand our knowledge, it will always be a tiny fraction of what there is to know.     For me, far from being depressing, this insight is actually the reason for joy, because it means that if you enjoy learning (and I do) you will never exhaust the opportunities to expand your knowledge.     There is simply no end to what there is to know. But you will never be able to know everything; there will never come a point when you can say, ‘we’ve got all this figured out.’ In fact, we have almost nothing figured out, and never will, and that’s a good thing.       ‘we monkeys are not running this show.’ A moment’s reflection is all it takes to arrive at this realization. If anything, our presence on the planet at this point is a threat to the smooth running of the ‘show’ (and by ‘show’ I mean the ongoing unfolding of life on earth). Far more than our species, as puffed up with self-importance as we may be, it is the other members of the community of life that are ‘running the show.’ In particular, it is the plants that are running the show.

        "excerpt":"   “How we spend our time is how we spend our days. How we spend our days is how our life goes. How our life goes determines whether we thought it was worth living.”     — Keith Yamashita       It’s easy to get caught up in the ebb and flow of day to day events, and sometimes it can seem like a bit of a slog. When that happens, it can be useful to step back for a few moments to reflect: The Universe is unfolding exactly as it should, as it always has and always will.     But what is cool is that we are all participating in this unfolding process; we are blessed to be part of it for as long as we are manifesting our being as nodes of consciousness, only a droplet in a vast ocean, but a droplet nonetheless — in this web of cosmic intelligence. We dwell on the absolute cutting edge of novelty, along with all sentient beings everywhere. Our uniqueness contributes to the making of every moment unique, unlike any other moment that has ever occurred in the history of the Universe.       Consuming information is not the same as acquiring knowledge. No idea could be further from the truth. Learning means being able to use new information. The basic process of learning consists of reflection and feedback. We learn facts and concepts through reflecting on experience—our own or others’. If you read something and you don’t make time to think about what you’ve read, you won’t be able to use any of the wisdom you’ve been exposed to.       Anxiety, anger, fear, jealousy, frustration, depression, grief, shame, loneliness, resentment, envy, greed…     The question isn’t how to keep these painful emotions from ever happening; the question is how to see them with wisdom and compassion whenever they happen.     The truth is, negative emotions can naturally transform themselves and open into an experience of pure psychological freedom. But only if you let them.       “It turns out that reality has a surprising amount of detail, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to open it up and see the gears inside. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.”          “There are some people whose confidence outweighs their knowledge, and they’re happy to say things which are wrong. And then there are other people who probably have all the knowledge but keep quiet because they’re scared of saying things.”     — Helen Jenkins, on the problem of communicating scientific uncertainty.       “The important thing about friends is that you need to have them before disaster befalls you. One reason is that, as we shall see later, people are only likely to make the effort to help you if they are already your friend. We are all much less likely to help strangers or people we know only slightly – despite what we sometimes claim. Making friends, however, requires a great deal of effort and time.” – Robin Dunbar     Friendships are more important than we realize. The closer the friendship the more it matters. Friendships protect us against disease, cognitive decline, and embed us with a sense of trust in the community. They also require constant reinforcement to maintain their strength.             Distance yourself from people that you don’t want to become.       Many of us spend our days locked in a mild state of anxiety and annoyance at all the problems we have to solve, both minor and major.     Should I quit my job—or stick it out?     What should I make for dinner tonight?     How am I ever going to find the right relationship?     Our attention narrows, our world contracts, and we convince ourselves that solving these problems will lead to a lasting state of happiness and freedom.     This, of course, is a fantasy.     Meditation shows you that happiness and freedom aren’t earned by solving your apparent problems, which are endless. Rather, happiness and freedom can only ever be the place from which you solve—and even enjoy—your problems.     Put another way, happiness and freedom are not the end goal of anything. They are the starting place for everything.       Often what seems like an expensive solution is a cheap solution (in the long run) and what seems like a cheap solution is very expensive (in the long run).     What seems expensive is often cheap in the long run.       “The thing that’s very clear is that when people hear information that comports with whatever their tribe believes, or whatever their tribe supports, they’re willing to accept it without doing a lot of digging into the quality of the source, the quality of the information, the implications of the rest of the information that goes with it. Anything that challenges what their tribe believes they are going to be more dismissive of whether or not it comes from a quality source.” – Todd Simkin       “Groundedness does not eliminate passion, productivity, or all forms of striving and ambition. Instead, it is about ditching an omnipresent and frantic anxiety to begin living in alignment with your innermost values, pursuing your interests, and expressing your authentic self in the here and now. When you are grounded there is no need to look up or down. You are where you are, and you hold true strength and power from that position. Your success, and the way in which you pursue it, becomes more enduring and robust. You gain the confidence to opt out of the consumer-driven rat-race that leaves you feeling like you are never enough.” — Brad Stulberg       “We stick to the wrong thing quite often, not because it will come to fruition by further effort but because we cannot let go of the way we have decided to tell the story, and we become further enmeshed even by trying to make sense of what entraps us, when what is needed is a simple, clean breaking away.”– David Whyte       The ability to self-monitor and change your interior dialogue is one of the most critical faculties that distinguish a mature, adult human, someone capable of functioning fully in the world.     That’s what takes you from a victim mentality to being proactive, from blaming others to taking ownership of your situation and taking positive steps to change it.       You don’t need enough courage for the entire journey. You only need courage for a few seconds to overcome self-doubt before you take the next step.       “When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.” — Viktor Frankl       We’re unintentionally stupid.     I like to think that I’m rational and capable of interpreting all information in a non-biased way but that’s a dream. Cognitive biases are great at explaining how our evolutionary programming leads us astray. Knowledge of these biases in advance rarely helps us make better decisions. There are, however, many easily recognizable situations that increase the odds we’re about to do something stupid. Whether we’re tired, overly focused on a goal, rushing, distracted, operating in a group, or under the influence of a group, we’re more prone to stupidity.       Our evolutionary programming conditions us to do what’s easy over what’s right. After all it’s often easier to signal being virtuous than actually being virtuous. We unconsciously make choices based on optics, politics, and defendability. We hate criticism and seek the validation of our peers and superiors. We often want to feel good about ourselves first and have the outcome we desire second.       “There’s a companion quality you’ll need to be the leaders you can be. That’s the willingness to take risks. Not reckless ones, but the risks that still remain after all the evidence has been considered. … Certainty is an illusion. Perfect safety is a mirage. Zero is always unattainable, except in the case of absolute zero where, as you remember, all motion and life itself stop. … the biggest risk of all is that we stop taking risks at all.”       “An initial period of concentration—conscious, directed attention—needs to be followed by some amount of unconscious processing. Mathematicians will often speak of the first phase of this process as “worrying” about a problem or idea. It’s a good word, because it evokes anxiety and upset while also conjuring an image of productivity: a dog worrying a bone, chewing at it to get to the marrow—the rich, meaty part of the problem that will lead to its solution. In this view of creative momentum, the key to solving a problem is to take a break from worrying, to move the problem to the back burner, to let the unwatched pot boil.”       “We have been fighting on this planet for ten thousand years; it would be idiotic and unethical to not take advantage of such accumulated experiences. If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren’t broad enough to sustain you.” — General Jim Mattis       Just as you watch what you put into your body or your mind, closely look at who you spend your time with. Are they kind? Are they honest? Are they thoughtful? Are they helping you or pulling you down? Are they reliable? Are they clear thinking? In short, are they the things you want to become? If not, don’t tempt fate, cut bate.     Distance yourself from the people you don’t want to become. Cultivate people in your life that make you better. People whose default behavior is your desired behavior. If circumstances make this difficult, choose among the eminent dead.       “Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that disconfirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science.” – The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene       In an expert-run industrialized economy, there’s a lot of pressure to be the one who’s sure, the person with all the answers.     Far more valuable is someone who has all the questions. The ability to figure out what hasn’t been figured out and see what hasn’t been seen is a significant advantage.     Rarest of all is the person with the humility (and confidence) to realize that even the list of questions can remain elusive. Finding the right questions might be the very thing we need to do. –Seth       If you succeed, no one will care. If you fail, no one will care. So just do what gives you energy. Period.       We spend hours consuming news because we want to be informed. The problem is news doesn’t make us informed. In fact, the more news we consume the more misinformed we become.       “When it comes to networks, the bigger the better, right? Not necessarily. Carefully curate your most trusted, inner circle and you’ll be surprised at how much more valuable you’ll become to the larger community of people in the world who care about the same things you do.”       “I belong everywhere I go, no matter where it is, or who I am with, as long as I never betray myself. The minute I become who you want me to be, in order to fit in and make sure people like me, is the moment I no longer belong anywhere.” — Brené Brown   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   While we tell ourselves that the next level is enough, it never is. The next zero in your bank account won’t satisfy you any more than you are now. The next promotion won’t change who you are. The fancy car won’t make you happier. The bigger house doesn’t solve your problems.     Pay attention to what you are chasing because, in the end, you just might get it. And the cost of “success” might be the things that really matter.     “Never risk what you have and need,” wrote Warren Buffett, “for what we don’t have and don’t need.” In pursuit of our goals, we inevitably give up things that matter. We sleep less. We spend less time with our friends. We eat unhealthily. We skip workouts. We cancel dates. We miss dinner with the family.     When it comes to living a meaningful life, the only scoreboard that matters is yours. Don’t let your ego get in the way of the person you really want to be or the life you really want to live.       “You have to give something back to your community that will allow people in the future a better education, a better opportunity, a better start in life. Wherever we are today as a society is built upon the past experiences of people and what they did to create a better world.” - Walter Scott       Perseverance solves more problems than brilliance.       Cycling has a carbon footprint of about 21g of CO2 per kilometre. That’s less than walking or getting the bus and less than a tenth the emissions of driving.     If cycling’s popularity in Britain increased six-fold (equivalent to returning to 1940s levels) and all this pedalling replaced driving, this could make a net reduction of 7.7-million tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to 6% of the UK’s transport emissions. https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/cycling-environmental-impact/       “Excellence is mundane. Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.”       There is nothing that gets in the way of success more than avoidance. We avoid hard conversations. We avoid certain people. We avoid hard decisions. We avoid evidence that contradicts what we think. We avoid starting a project until we’re certain of the outcome.     Not only does avoiding today make the future harder, but it also almost always makes the present harder. Avoiding puts you on a hair-trigger, anything will set you off. We all do this. Who hasn’t entirely avoided a hard conversation with their partner about something only to find themselves in an insignificant argument over something trivial? Of course, the petty fight isn’t about the trivial thing, it’s about avoidance of the hard thing.     Everything becomes harder until we stop avoiding what’s getting in the way. The longer you wait the higher the cost.         One of the challenges (and opportunities) of researching a big topic is just how many different views could plausibly relate. It’s easy to get comfortable with one set of results only to realize there’s an entire discipline that weighs in on the questions you ask.     The paradox of learning is that the more you know, the more you realize you don’t. Each answered question spawns myriad doubts.       Efficient doesn’t necessarily mean effective. More productive doesn’t necessarily mean more powerful. Being mass, ignored and expensive are not points of weakness but, in fact, points of strength.     It doesn’t matter how efficient you are if you are not effective. What’s efficient in the short term is often increasingly fragile. Don’t win the moment at the expense of the decade.     https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-errors-of-efficiency       You don’t know how to think other than the way you know how to think.       “It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.” — Elinor Smith       We tend to think that what we think is true. And because we think something is true, we ignore information that might tell us it’s not true.     “If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change,” Marcus Aurelius said. “For I seek the truth, by which no one ever was truly harmed. Harmed is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance.”     “What surprise tells you,” my friend Adam Robinson says, “is that your model of the world is incorrect.” And when your model of the world is incorrect, you need to figure out why.     Surprises are a clue that you’re missing something. Dive and figure out what.       liquid modernity: the idea that we always need to keep our options open and avoid committing to causes, communities and projects.     We live in a culture that prizes keeping one’s options open. It’s better to be maximally flexible, the popular reasoning goes, so that we can respond to any opportunity at a moment’s notice. Committing to anything, even for just a few months, locks away other possibilities, and is thus undesirable.     Examined closely, the reasoning behind this liquid modernity doesn’t hold up. Even if you want a more varied life than the long-haul commitment you still need to commit to projects for bursts of time to make progress. The person who commits to three-month projects may not achieve mastery. Still, they will get further than the person who merely thinks about doing those projects.       “If we are sincere in wanting to learn the truth, and if we know how to use gentle speech and deep listening, we are much more likely to be able to hear others’ honest perceptions and feelings. In that process, we may discover that they too have wrong perceptions. After listening to them fully, we have an opportunity to help them correct their wrong perceptions. If we approach our hurts that way, we have the chance to turn our fear and anger into opportunities for deeper, more honest relationships.” — Thich Nhat Hanh       “Make no mistake about it—enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It’s the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.” -   Adyashanti       Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here, And you must treat it as a powerful stranger, Must ask permission to know it and be known. The forest breathes. Listen. It answers, I have made this place around you. If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here. No two trees are the same to Raven. No two branches are the same to Wren. If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you, You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows Where you are. You must let it find you. — “Lost” by David Wagoner       Ideas are cheap. Execution is expensive. The ability to execute separates people, not the ability to come up with ideas.       “Reading after a certain age diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, just as the man who spends too much time in the theater is tempted to be content with living vicariously instead of living his own life.” — Albert Einstein       You’re almost certainly worse at understanding your own biases than you are at recognizing them in others.       There’s nothing you can do to change the mental processes of others. You can only accept them. But that acceptance can help the world make more sense, whether it’s personal interactions or world politics. Realizing that political and social movements spring from the decisions of individuals working with incomplete information and a set of unknowable biases, instead of from a cabal of powerful people secretly plotting world domination, could mean you’re less likely to fall for conspiracy theories…and suddenly, the fact that hundreds of talented, intelligent people devoted their professional lives to producing the movie version of Cats makes sense.     It’s a great relief in interpersonal relations, as well. Knowing that your fantasy football rival and your co-workers at the batting cage are just bumbling along means you can stop obsessing over their motivations. No one knows what they’re doing, after all, and they’re probably just trying to make things easier for themselves in the short term.     You shouldn’t, however, mention any of this to loved ones. Just pretend it all makes sense. It’s how we get along.       “External ambitions are never satisfied because there’s always something more to achieve. … There’s an aesthetic joy we feel when we see morally good action, when we run across someone who is quiet and humble and good, when we see that however old we are, there’s lots to do ahead. The stumbler doesn’t build her life by being better than others, but by being better than she used to be.” https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/david-brooks-the-moral-bucket-list.html         “The nature of illusion is that it’s designed to make you feel good. About yourself, about your country, about where you’re going – in that sense it functions like a drug. Those who question that illusion are challenged not so much for the veracity of what they say, but for puncturing those feelings.” — Journalist Chris Hedges       Humility is the anecdote to arrogance. Humility is a recognition that we don’t know, that we were wrong, that we’re not better than anyone else.     Humility is simple to understand but hard to practice.     Humility isn’t a lack of confidence but an earned confidence. The confidence to say that you might not be right, but you’ve done the diligence, and you’ve put in the work.     Humility keeps you wondering what you’re missing or if someone is working harder than you. And yet when pride and arrogance take over, humility flees and so does our ability to learn, adapt, and build lasting relationships with others.     Humility won’t let you take credit for luck. And humility is the voice in your mind that doesn’t let small victories seem larger than they are. Humility is the voice inside your head that says, ‘anyone can do it once, that’s luck. Can you do it consistently?’     More than knowing yourself, humility is accepting yourself.       “Guard over your thinking, for it becomes actions. Your actions slowly turn into habits. Over time, your habits shape your character. And in the end, your character becomes your destiny. If you want to change your destiny, change your thinking.”       You’re avoiding this because it’s hard. You already know what to do. The evidence has been staring at you in the face for months.       The purpose of a question is to dig deeper, not to prove anything.       Things that reduce the odds of long-term success:     A lack of focus. Making excuses. Staying up late. Eating poorly. Checking email first thing in the AM. Working more to fix being busy. Buying things you don’t have the money for. Focusing on yourself. Letting other people define success for you. The wrong relationships. A lack of patience.       Things that never happened before happen all the time. — Scott Sagan       Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you. — Anne Lamott       It requires a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious. — Alfred North Whitehead       Believe those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it.  — André Gide      ","categories": ["statuses"],

The world can never own a man who wants nothing.” — Aphorisms for Thirsty Fish         “The debate over labor and leisure is often fought between the Self-Helpers and the Socialists. The Self-Helpers say that individuals have agency to solve their problems and can reduce their anxiety through new habits and values. The Socialists say that this individualist ethos is a dangerous myth. Instead, they insist that almost all modern anxieties arise from structural inequalities that require structural solutions, like a dramatic reconfiguration of the economy and stronger labor laws to protect worker rights.”     https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/why-you-never-have-time/603937/       Intensity is overrated. Consistency is underrated.       “The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanations of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, ‘Seek simplicity and distrust it.’” — Alfred North Whitehead       Discipline creates skill.       “It is a fault to wish to be understood before we have made ourselves clear to ourselves.” — Simone Weil         Focus on what you can control.       You control how you respond to things.       Ask yourself, “Is this essential?”       Meditate on your mortality every day.       Value time more than money and possessions.       You are the product of your habits.       Remember you have the power to have no opinion.       Own the morning.       Put yourself up for review. Interrogate yourself.       Don’t suffer imagined troubles.       Try to see the good in people.       Never be overheard complaining—even to yourself.       “You only need to know the direction, not the destination. The direction is enough to make the next choice.” — James Clear       A critical quality for success is the ability to change your mind. A lot of ideas are bad until they’re good. And a lot of ideas are good until they’re bad.       Before making a decision, ask yourself these two questions “Will it help you do what you already want to do? Will it help you feel successful? The answers to those questions are freeing because if the change program doesn’t satisfy these two requirements, it’s not worth your time. ”       “Metacognition is the capacity or skill to become aware of one’s own mental process. So on the one hand it seems kind of obvious, but if you say, today I’m going to try to notice and simply just notice a part of my mental process I had not yet been aware of. Now that’s interesting because what that is, it’s not just an observational thing. You’ll notice it opens doors to things you never thought of.”       “There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. On one extreme, the explainer can painstakingly craft a beautiful explanation, leading their audience to understanding without even realizing it could have been difficult. On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle”       “You can never tell what apparently small discovery will lead to. Somebody discovers something and immediately a host of experimenters and inventors are playing all the variations upon it.” — Edison         What looks like success is often just patience.       “Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.”       ‘There’s a reset button at every level. Meaning you can be the best in class. And when you go to the next level you’re then at the bottom. And the difference between amateurism and professionalism is you have people looking after you and holding your hand as an amateur. Professionally, no one does. … What matters is, what you do and how you apply yourself consistently.’       Too many people filter things out because they’re not true. A better question is: does it work?       “Groups of prosocial individuals will survive and reproduce better than groups of antisocial individuals, even if antisocial individuals have the advantage over prosocial individuals within groups.” — https://www.huffpost.com/entry/truth-and-reconciliation_b_154660       The best decisions have little to no immediate payoff.     The best choices compound. Most of the benefits come at the end, not the beginning.     The more patient you are, the bigger the payoff.       “Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.”       The average person is consuming way too much information. We’re being bombarded with news and different forms of advertising all the time. In fact, we’re so used to consuming content and news that it doesn’t even seem weird anymore. We feel like it’s normal and believe that we miss out on something if we spend more than a few minutes being offline. The truth, however, is that this massive information overload is ruining our peace of mind as well as our productivity.       A group will never admit they were wrong.

        "excerpt":"   One simple way to unlock your best self is to shape your environment so that your desired behavior is the path of least resistance.         “The willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life is the source from which self-respect springs.”     — Joan Didion       Wherever you are right now, pause and look around you. Feel your feet on the ground. Feel the texture of the phone in your hand. Hear the sounds, near and far. Relax your eyes, open your peripheral vision, and receive light from the visual field.     Marvel at the complexity and intricacy of everything happening on it’s own. And let this next breath come as it will, with no effort from you, as if you were being breathed.     You’re here. You’re alive. This is it. What more is there to be grateful for?       “A tribe without enemies is, almost by definition, not a tribe. As a consequence, tribal dispute and warfare is part of what defines humanity.”     “Things have changed a lot since. The biggest enemy we have to fight against right now is our tribal past. What served us so well for thousands of years is now an obsolete concept. It’s no more about the survival of this tribe or that one, but about Homo sapiens as a species. … For the first time in our collective history, we must think of ourselves as a single tribe on a single planet. … We are a single tribe, the tribe of humans. And, as such, not a tribe at all.”     — Marcelo Gleiser       “Run your own race, as in: you set certain standards for yourself, and you focus on meeting them. When you meet them, you’re proud of yourself. When you don’t, you urge yourself to try harder. You don’t question your standards based on what anyone else is doing. You don’t look over at someone else’s race and think, I’m doing a bad job because you’re going faster. You just focus on your own pace.”       “Always remember that to argue, and win, is to break down the reality of the person you are arguing against. It is painful to lose your reality, so be kind, even if you are right.”     — Haruki Murakami       If you fight with reality you will definitely loose 100% of the time.       The Laughing Heart     your life is your life don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission. be on the watch. there are ways out. there is light somewhere. it may not be much light but it beats the darkness. be on the watch. the gods will offer you chances. know them. take them. you can’t beat death but you can beat death in life, sometimes. and the more often you learn to do it, the more light there will be. your life is your life. know it while you have it. you are marvelous the gods wait to delight in you.     — Charles Bukowski       “What is truth to one may be a disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.”       Do less but do better.     Any energy that goes into what doesn’t matter comes at the expense of what does. With a little extra time, you can raise the standard from good enough to great.     Narrow the focus. Raise the standard. And set yourself apart.       It’s more important to be helpful, than to sound smart and intellectual.       “I believe that if we are honest with ourselves, the most fascinating problem in the world is, ‘Who am I?’ Most of us feel that we are a center of awareness that resides in the middle of a bag of skin… a skin-encapsulated ego. I want to examine the strange feeling of being an isolated self…”     — Myth of Myself by Alan Watts       “Each of you is perfect the way you are… and you can use a little improvement.”     —SHUNRYU SUZUKI ROSHI       One big mistake people repeatedly make is focusing on proving themselves right, instead of focusing on achieving the best outcome.       “I notice that when all a man’s information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be. A man has to get a perspective, and he can get it from books or from people — preferably from both. This thing of sleeping and eating with your business can easily be overdone; it is all well enough—usually necessary—in times of trouble but as a steady diet it does not make for good business; a man ought now and then to get far enough away to have a look at himself and his affairs.”     — Harvey S. Firestone        Most problems come from our internal state.     When we are internally calm, we reason and then respond; we don’t just react. When someone slights us, we don’t lash out with angry words or angry fists. We turn the other cheek. When someone cuts us off, we give them the benefit of the doubt. When things go slower than we want, we wait patiently. When someone is passive-aggressive, we refuse to take the bait. At our best, we put behavior in perspective—both other people’s and our own. We do the right thing, not the easy thing, regardless of influence or pressure.     A calm mind is not the absence of conflict or stress, but the ability to cope with it.       Move beyond simple New Year’s resolutions and recognize that every moment of life is an opportunity to start fresh.     What if you could start your life over… now?       Few people will know if you spend your weekends learning or binge watching TV (unless you tell them on social media!), but they will notice the difference over time.     Many successful people develop good habits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal relationships, work, learning, and self-care. Such habits help them move forward while staying healthy.       I think that individuals who aim to lift others during every step of their own journey often achieve better outcomes for themselves.       “The root of all desires is the one desire: to come home, to be at peace.”     —JEAN KLEIN       “The root of most mistakes, both personally and sort of historically, it’s one of the passions, right? Envy, lust, anger, fear, pain, worry. Those emotional states that take us out of the rational part of ourselves and into some sort of frenzied or flurried or consumed part.”       “A year from now you will wish you had started today.”     — Karen Lamb       We become what we consume. What you read today becomes the raw material of your thoughts tomorrow. High-quality inputs offer high-quality raw materials to assemble in the future.     A person with an environment with rich sources of information makes better choices than someone consuming low-quality sources of information. Not only do they have better raw material, but they also have a broader perspective and a calmer mind.     The same applies to food. What we eat today is what we become tomorrow. All things being equal, the person that eats healthier will live longer and avoid more problems than someone who does not.       People tend to hang around people like themselves. That explains why if your friends watch TV every night, you eventually will too. You can take this in all sorts of directions. If you spend a lot of time with people who are kind and thoughtful, you will act that way too. If you spend time with people who share a certain politics, you eventually see things similarly. It also explains why, if you start spending time with people who are unlike you in certain ways you want to cultivate, you will become like them. All of this happens without conscious awareness.     By choosing who you spend time with you are also choosing who you want to be. This is the environmental force at work on your subconscious and your biological instincts.       Curate your information diet to be rich and diverse.     Follow people who think differently than you. Read old books. Remember that what you put into your mind today is the raw material you have to work with tomorrow.       Design your environment knowing it will influence your future self.     You can easily make undesired behaviors harder and desired behaviors easier.     Understanding the invisible influence of your environment allows you to turn your desired behaviors into your default behaviors.       “The direct approach is radical. It cuts through the leaves and branches and takes us directly to the root—which is the illusion of duality and separation. Eventually, in a moment out of time, these experiments will reveal to you the wonder and simplicity of reality, just as it is.”     —STEPHAN BODIAN        Being busy is another way of saying your life is out of control.       Real richness is defined by how you make your decisions, how you spend your time, and how happy you ultimately feel.     Stop fighting for goals you think you should achieve and start creating your own definition of “happy” and “rich.”       “One of the big traps we have in the West is our intelligence, because we want to know that we know. Freedom allows you to be wise, but you cannot know wisdom, you must be wisdom. When my guru wanted to put me down, he called me ‘clever.’ When he wanted to reward me, he would call me ‘simple.’ The intellect is a beautiful servant, but a terrible master. Intellect is the power tool of our separateness. The intuitive, compassionate heart is the doorway to our unity.”     — Ram Dass       The business model of Fast Fashion has led to an enormous increase in the amounts of clothes that are produced, sold, and discarded.     According to McKinsey, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2014, and the average consumer buys 60% more garments each year. At the same time, these clothes are kept only half as long as they were a mere fifteen years ago.     A staggering 100 billion items of clothing are produced each year, that’s nearly 14 items for every human being on the planet. Some of those never even reach the consumer; it caused a minor outrage when in 2018 a luxury brand admitted to burning clothes just to ‘protect the brand’.     Yet, with clothes being so cheap, people do not wear at least 50 percent of their wardrobes, according to a study.     The apparel and footwear industries together account for more than 8 percent of global climate impact, greater than all international airline flights and maritime shipping trips combined.     Water usage for growing cotton has led to drastic shrinkage of the Aral sea, and dyeing and treatment of garments makes up roughly 17-20% of all industrial water pollution.     url   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   “The nature of illusion is that it’s designed to make you feel good. About yourself, about your country, about where you’re going – in that sense it functions like a drug. Those who question that illusion are challenged not so much for the veracity of what they say, but for puncturing those feelings.”     — Chris Hedges         “For people who achieve great things, they often maintain a very ordinary mentality. In other words, if you keep an ordinary mind, accept yourself as you are, and do well for yourself, you can often do things well. Ordinary people can do extraordinary things.”       “There are three things you cannot buy. Fitness: You have to keep fit, whether you’re rich or not. Diet: You cannot pay someone to be on a diet for you. I think that diet is the biggest sacrifice in my life. Then, looking after your soul. No one can possibly treat your soul but you yourself. This is something you can do through culture and philosophy.”     — Brunello Cucinelli       There is somebody out there less talented than you     Who is just willing to be a bit crazier than you.     Who is willing to just work a little harder than you.     Who is willing to get just a little more uncomfortable than you.     Who is willing to ask for what they want.     Who is willing to put themselves out there and take a risk.     One day you will meet this person.     And they will beat you.     Stop pretending to be too cool for school.     Stop worrying about what other people will think about you.     Stop just doing the bare minimum because you have the talent to do so.     Now is the time to get a little uncomfortable.     Now is the time to look a little foolish.     Now is the time to put in just that little extra.     Make that post.     Record that video.     Make that call.     Ask the question.     One of my favorite quotes for a long time has been this.     “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”     It’s ok to be unreasonable sometimes.     Progress depends on it.     In fact YOUR progress depends on it.       A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse.       “The most important step in becoming successful in anything is to first become interested in it.”     — Sir William Osler       The things people love about you aren’t necessarily the things you want to be loved for. They decide they like you for reasons completely outside your control, of which you’re often not even conscious: it’s certainly not because of the big act you put on, all the charm and anecdotes you’ve calculated for effect. (And if your act does fool someone, it only makes you feel like a successful fraud, and harbor some secret contempt for them — the contempt of a con artist for his mark — plus now you’re condemned to keep up that act forever, lest he/she Realize.) … At some point you have to accept that other people’s perceptions of you are as valid as (and probably a lot more objective than) your own.       “Everything interacts and is dependent on other things. We must think more thoroughly about what we are doing, how we are doing it, and why we are doing it.”     url       To maximize your life enjoyment, you should die with no money left over. Spend your money while you can get the most experiences from it, not when you are old. Give away what you are going to give away (to kids or charity) while you can enjoy and direct it, and when it makes the most difference to the receiver.’     –Die with Zero       Whose definition of success are you chasing?       If your idea of success/victory is having/getting something that your friends/neighbours don’t have, its mostly a sickness.       Some people face more losses and disappointments than others, due to luck, circumstances, judgment, or even a tendency to take a lot of risks. But no matter who you are, failure will find you. The question is not whether you will fail but how you will use your failures.     url       The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.     — Mary Oliver       The mind, when distracted, takes in nothing very deeply, but rejects everything that is, as it were, crammed into it. There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living: there is nothing that is harder to learn.       You are only as sick as your secrets.         “There is and can be no ultimate solution for us to discover, but instead a permanent need for balancing contradictory claims, for careful trade-offs between conflicting values, toleration of difference, consideration of the specific factors at play when a choice is needed, not reliance on an abstract blueprint claimed to be applicable everywhere, always, to all people.”       “We like to think we have conscious control over our behavior, but the more we learn, the more we know that that’s not entirely true. We’re less in control than we’d like.”       Freedom comes from the ability to let go – to need less. Your inner strength is directly proportional to what you can live without.     There is nobody in the world more powerful than the person who wants nothing. What power can one possibly have over them?       Privilege is invisible to all those who have it.       Not many people have consistent discipline when times are good. Even fewer in times of stress.     Anyone can do something once. Not everyone can do it consistently. Eating healthy for a meal is common. Eating healthy all week is not. Working out occasionally is common. Working out a few times a week is not. Going to bed on time is easy. Doing it for a week is not.     Positioning yourself for future success is simple but not easy. The hardest part is the discipline required to do otherwise ordinary things for an extraordinarily long period of time, even when the results are barely noticeable.     When people say you need to love the process, this is what they mean.       What important truth do very few people agree with you on?       Forget time management – we have enough time. The resource that is truly limited is your attention.     Your attention is gold – stop wasting it by just being busy.        we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences.       “My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better constituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and if I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.” — Charles Darwin       When people seem uncommonly disciplined, look for a powerful ritual hiding in plain sight. It’s not that they have more discipline than you or I, but they were able to turn that discipline into consistency with a ritual. Short-term results come from intensity but long-term results come from consistency. Turning intensity into consistency unlocks a powerful asymmetry.       “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.”     “Why?     “Because you’re thinking about it!”     The Focusing Illusion is responsible for a lot of our unhappiness. It is the key to understanding why you pay more attention to your thoughts about how to live than living itself.       self-care is about giving the world the best of you instead of what’s left of you.       If you survey enough people all advices cancel to zero.   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   People are much more honest with their actions than their words.       “The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place.” — George Bernard Shaw       “Patience is not passive, on the contrary, it is concentrated strength.” ― Bruce Lee     Active in the moment but patient with the results.     Active patience.       “We write for the same reason that we walk, talk, climb mountains or swim the oceans — because we can. We have some impulse within us that makes us want to explain ourselves to other human beings. That’s why we paint, that’s why we dare to love someone- because we have the impulse to explain who we are. Not just how tall we are, or thin… but who we are internally… perhaps even spiritually. There’s something, which impels us to show our inner-souls. The more courageous we are, the more we succeed in explaining what we know.”     — Maya Angelou       “Culture is a perversion. It fetishizes objects, creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness, endless forms of false understanding in the form of squirrelly religions and silly cults. It invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanize themselves by behaving like machines.” –Terence McKenna       “Good writing is always about things that are important to you, things that are scary to you, things that eat you up. But the writing is a way of not allowing those things to destroy you.”     — John Edgar Wideman       Do nothing for prestige or status or money or approval alone.     As Paul Graham observed, “prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to like.” Those extrinsic motivators are fine and can feel life-affirming at the moment, but they ultimately don’t make it thrilling to get up in the morning and gratifying to go to sleep at night — and, in fact, they can often distract and detract from the things that do offer those deeper rewards.       Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.     We live in a culture where one of the greatest social disgraces is not having an opinion, so we often form our “opinions” based on superficial impressions or the borrowed ideas of others, without investing the time and thought that cultivating true conviction necessitates. We then go around asserting these donned opinions and clinging to them as anchors to our own reality. It’s enormously disorienting to simply say, “I don’t know.” But it’s infinitely more rewarding to understand than to be right — even if that means changing your mind about a topic, an ideology, or, above all, yourself.       To understand and be understood, those are among life’s greatest gifts, and every interaction is an opportunity to exchange them.       Be as religious and disciplined about your sleep as you are about your work.     We tend to wear our ability to get by on little sleep as some sort of badge of honor that validates our work ethic. But what it really is is a profound failure of self-respect and of priorities. What could possibly be more important than your health and your sanity, from which all else springs?       When people tell you who they are, believe them.     However, when people try to tell you who you are, don’t believe them. You are the only custodian of your own integrity and the assumptions made by those that misunderstand who you are and what you stand for reveal a great deal about them and absolutely nothing about you.       “Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.”     The myth of overnight success is just that — a myth — as well as a reminder that our present definition of success needs serious retuning.     The flower doesn’t go from bud to blossom in one spritely burst and yet, as a culture, we’re disinterested in the tedium of the blossoming. But that’s where all the real magic unfolds in the making of one’s character and destiny.       Question your maps and models of the universe, both inner and outer, and continually test them against the raw input of reality.     Our maps are still maps, approximating the landscape of truth from the territories of the knowable — incomplete representational models that always leave more to map, more to fathom, because the selfsame forces that made the universe also made the figuring instrument with which we try to comprehend it.       First-principles thinking is a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.       “Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men’s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us.”     — Daniel Burnham       “The older we get, the more we need our friends—and the harder it is to keep them.”       I think that the highest privilege one can have in life is the liberty of failing as much as needed without having to quit the game.       “He was the greatest conqueror the world ever knew because he was more open to learning than any other conqueror has ever been.”     → The Legend of Genghis Khan       The only thing people hate more than the truth is the person who dare to speak it.       Go beyond what you like and dislike…                What appears to be luck is often preparation and patience.     Mastering your circumstances starts with being ready.       “(There is a) remarkable asymmetry between the ways our mind treats information that is currently available and information we do not have. An essential design feature of the associative machine is that it represents only activated ideas. Information that is not retrieved (even unconsciously) from memory might as well not exist. System 1 excels at constructing the best possible story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not (cannot) allow for information it does not have.”     — Daniel Kahneman       I ended up realizing that if anyone makes me mad, they own me. So, I try to not get mad anymore — Mike Tyson     Anger is a way to give control of your brain over to others. The news has been doing it for years. They use anger to get your attention and drain your life.     Don’t get mad at randoms. Just be silent.       “Dogmatism and skepticism are both, in a sense, absolute philosophies; one is certain of knowing, the other of not knowing. What philosophy should dissipate is certainty, whether of knowledge or ignorance.” ​     — Bertrand Russell       A lot of people miss useful ideas hiding in plain sight because they search for accuracy.     If you dismiss an idea because it is not 100% correct, you miss many ideas that are perfectly useful.     The real test for an idea, theory, or advice is utility. The more useful, the better.       Stop looking for that next YouTube video and start applying whatever you already know.       Everyone has an emotional blind spot when they fight. Work out what yours is, and remember it.

        "excerpt":"   In turning education into a system of mass production we created a superbly democratic system that made the majority of people, and the world as a whole, much better off. It was the right decision. But we lost the most elegant and beautiful minds who were created via an artisanal process.       “Don’t deceive yourself into thinking you’re being sucked into your technologies. Instead, see your tech use for what it is: you knowing what you like, and you choosing to engage in it (at the cost of other opportunities).”       If someone says “I am lying,” and they are actually lying, then they are actually telling the truth, which means they are actually lying.       “He realized, like most uber-productive people, that, while there were many behaviors needed to guarantee high output, there was one single behavior guaranteed to prevent all output:     Trying to please everyone.”       “Most men are not wicked. Men become bad and guilty because they speak and act without foreseeing the results of their words and their deeds. They are sleepwalkers, not evildoers.”       Some of the most amazing things that will happen to you in life will come out of embracing your fears and taking a risk, no matter how uncertain it might be. That’s what it means to truly live. One day, however, you’re going to look back with regrets and wondering what might have been. You’ll look back and think you could have done more with your life but didn’t because you didn’t embrace uncertainties.     And the truth is it’s going to feel much worse to discover that your fears were unfounded and your hunch was wrong.       “The whole world is a series of miracles, but we’re so used to them we call them ordinary things.”       “You should, in science, believe logic and arguments, carefully drawn, and not authorities.”     — Richard Feynman       “When someone is giving you feedback, they’re doing you a favor. Even if you’re upset to hear about your mistakes, and even if you think they are wrong and you shouldn’t change your behavior, they’re giving you the gift of information you didn’t have before.”       “The time to prepare for your next expedition is when you have just returned from a successful trip.”         Robert Peary         “We create our buildings and then they create us. Likewise, we construct our circle of friends and our communities and then they construct us.”         Frank Lloyd Wright         Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.       “When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about it is that what seemed at the time most significant and seductive, seems now most futile and absurd. For instance, success in all of its various guises; being known and being praised; ostensible pleasures, like acquiring money or seducing women, or traveling, going to and fro in the world and up and down in it like Satan, explaining and experiencing whatever Vanity Fair has to offer. In retrospect, all these exercises in self-gratification seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called, “licking the earth.””     — Stephen Covey       Homogeneous groups were more confident in their decisions, even though they were more often wrong in their conclusions.       Look around your environment.     Rather than seeing items as objects, see them as magnets for your attention. Each object gently pulls a certain amount of your attention toward it.     Whenever you discard something, the tug of that object is released. You get some attention back.       Why, even in peacetime, do friends become enemies? And why, even in wartime, do enemies become friends?       “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”          Kurt Vonnegut         Be more kind to your future self.       Fame and fortune don’t guarantee happiness. Nor does relentless self-promotion. Nor does having a gazillion social media followers or seeing tweets go viral.     Those achievements won’t win you (genuine) friends or sort out arguments with your partner. They won’t insulate you from stress or nurture your physical and mental health. They won’t ensure you are loved.       Today, not tomorrow.     What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow.     Today’s choices become tomorrow’s position. If you put off things today, they don’t magically disappear tomorrow. They just get added to the list of things you want to do.     Don’t wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow is where dreams go to die.       “Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master. This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth.”       People often discuss the standard trendy topics and explain why people working in the field today are doing it wrong and then explain how they would do it instead.     What I’ve found when I’ve asked for details is that, in areas where I have some knowledge, people generally don’t know what sub-problems need to be solved to solve the problem they’re trying to address, making their solution hopeless. After having done this many times, my opinion is that the root cause of this is generally that many people who have a superficial understanding of topic assume that the topic is as complex as their understanding of the topic instead of realizing that only knowing a bit about a topic means that they’re missing an understanding of the full complexity of a topic.       To avoid future regrets, have a bias for action. Speak up. Try stuff. Shoot your shot. Take the chance. URL       The desire to look wealthy comes from a place of insecurity. Don’t waste your life doing things you don’t want to do just because you can buy nice things.       “Be brave and clear. Follow your heart and don’t be overly influenced by outside factors. Be true to yourself.”          Shirley Temple            “You can tell how good someone is at making decisions by how much time they have. Busy people spend a lot of time correcting poor decisions, so they don’t have time to make good decisions. Good decisions need good thinking, and that requires time.”       “They laugh at me because I’m different; I laugh at them because they’re all the same.”       “When our public square is governed by mob dynamics unrestrained by due process, we don’t get justice and inclusion; we get a society that ignores context, proportionality, mercy, and truth.”     The key to designing a sustainable republic, therefore, was to build in mechanisms to slow things down, cool passions, require compromise, and give leaders some insulation from the mania of the moment while still holding them accountable to the people periodically, on Election Day.     A (long) good read: URL       Most people underestimate how our small daily actions shape our future. They think that big life changes lead to huge differences in our lives, but they don’t pay much attention to what they do every single day.     Yet, the truth is, what we do (or don’t do) day after day determines how we feel and what we end up creating (or destroying).       “A problem is a chance for you to do your best.”          Duke Ellington      ","categories": ["statuses"],

Live as if you’ve died and come back (every minute is bonus time).       “The best revenge is not to be like that.” —Marcus Aurelius       Be strict with yourself and tolerant with others.       Put every impression, emotion, to the test before acting on it.       Learn something from everyone.       Focus on process, not outcomes.       Define what success means to you.

        "excerpt":"   Say no (a lot).       Don’t be afraid to ask for help.       Find one thing that makes you wiser every day.       What’s bad for the hive is bad for the bee.       Don’t judge other people.       Study the lives of the greats.       Forgive, forgive, forgive.       Make a little progress each day.       Journal.       Prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks.       Look for the poetry in ordinary things.       To do wrong to one, is to do wrong to yourself.       Always choose “alive time.”       Associate only with people that make you better.       If someone offends you, realize you are complicit in taking offense.       Fate behaves as she pleases…do not forget this.       Possessions are yours only in trust.       Don’t make your problems worse by bemoaning them.       Accept success without arrogance, handle failure with indifference.        Courage. Temperance. Justice. Wisdom. (Always).       Focus is, in many ways, the opposite of busyness. While busyness manifests itself as anxiety, a hectic rush between errands, mess and chaos, focus is calm, clear and quiet.     Focus is an outward manifestation of an attentional state that says, “What I’m doing now is what is important, everything else will have to wait.” Busyness is the mindset that flits between tasks and ideas, both things that are being worked on in the moment and worries about things that cannot be dealt with right now.       The key to overcoming busyness is to start saying no. Not to everything, mind you, but to the things that aren’t important. This isn’t easy—social pressures and cultural expectations may demand you say yes to a lot of things. However, avoiding the trap of busyness requires it.       “You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.” ​— Kahlil Gibran       “The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one’s appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship.”         Amelia Earhart         The only way to become good at something is to practice the ordinary basics for an uncommon length of time. Most people get bored. They want excitement. They want something to talk about and no one talks about the boring basics.       In a world of social media, we glorify the results and not the process. We see the kick that knocked someone out but not the years of effort that went into perfecting it. We see the results, not the hard work.     The difference between good and great results is often found in consistently doing the boring things you know you should do exactly when you feel like doing them the least.       Unfortunately, most of us, most of the time, don’t have a bias toward action. We don’t start a conversation with the cute stranger we’ve been admiring. We don’t ask for the raise we feel we’ve earned. We don’t move to the city we’ve been dreaming of since childhood. And we don’t do these things because not doing them is easier than acting. That’s not to say the outcome will be better. It will almost always be worse. But the comfort of the discontented status quo is much less scary than the potential of the unknown.       “Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” – Lao Tzu       The smallness of your mind make you think you are big.       “Living your life the way you want is not selfish. Forcing other people to live their lives the way you want is selfish.”       “If you react negatively to a situation, now you have two problems.”       “I remember my grandfather telling me how each of us must live with a full measure of loneliness that is inescapable, and we must not destroy ourselves with our passion to escape the aloneness.” ​— Jim Harrison   ","categories": ["statuses"],

        "excerpt":"   To improve your outcomes in life, respond to the world as it is, not as you wish it would be.       Many organizations are obsessed with efficiency. They want to be sure every resource is utilized to its fullest capacity and everyone is sprinting around every minute of the day doing something. They hire expert consultants to sniff out the faintest whiff of waste. As individuals, many of us are also obsessed with the mirage of total efficiency. We schedule every minute of our day, pride ourselves on forgoing breaks, and berate ourselves for the slightest moment of distraction. We view sleep, sickness, and burnout as unwelcome weaknesses and idolize those who never seem to succumb to them. This view, however, fails to recognize that efficiency and effectiveness are not the same things.       “As I came down from the mountain, I recalled how, not many years ago, it was access to information and movement that seemed our greatest luxury; nowadays it’s often freedom from information, the chance to sit still, that feels like the ultimate prize. Stillness is not just an indulgence for those with enough resources—it’s a necessity for anyone who wishes to gather less visible resources.”     — Pico Iyer in The Art of Stillness       One of the most valuable skills you can adopt in life is doing things when you don’t feel like doing them.     Design the defaults and don’t negotiate with yourself.       “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” — André Gid       “I’ll do it tomorrow”     The idea we’ll have more time in the future is an illusion. If there isn’t time then it isn’t a priority. It’s a priority problem disguised as a time problem.       “I would rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned.” ​— Richard Feynman       Focus on one thing you can do today to make tomorrow easier. Repeat.       If you read or watch TV programs about business or sports, you often see the world framed as place where everyone wants “more more more” for “me me me,” every minute in every way. The old bumper sticker sums it up: “Whoever dies with the most toys wins.” The potent but usually unstated message is that we are all trapped in a life-long contest where people can never get enough money, prestige, victories, cool stuff, beauty, or sex — and that we do want and should want more goodies than everyone else.     This attitude fuels a quest for constant improvement that has a big upside, leading to everything from more beautiful athletic and artistic performances, to more elegant and functional products, to better surgical procedures and medicines, to more effective and humane organizations. Yet when taken too far, this blend of constant dissatisfaction, unquenchable desires, and overbearing competitiveness can damage your mental health. It can lead you to treat those “below” you as inferior creatures who are worthy of your disdain and people “above” you who have more stuff and status as objects of envy and jealousy.       “We are put on this planet only once, and to limit ourselves to the familiar is a crime against our mind.”         Roger Ebert         “The most practical decision-making is not making better choices, it’s learning to deal with uncertainty. The most common thing holding people back from the right answer is holding on to your previous beliefs. Instead of instinctively rejecting new information, take in what comes your way through a system of evaluating probabilities.”       We often think happiness is about self-care, treating ourselves, and giving ourselves these luxuries. It’s not. In fact, if anything, it’s about doing nice things for others. That gives you more of a happiness bang for your buck than spending time on yourself.       “When life gets scary and difficult, we tend to look for solutions in places where it is easy or at least familiar to do so, and not in the dark, uncomfortable places where real solutions might lie.”       Most people don’t even realize that they’re living someone else’s life. Never stopping to question who they are or what they’re told, they slot right into the happiness they’re told to accept. Then, they wake up 20 years later with a belly full of regret and a future they don’t recognize.       Learn to question every single thing     If you’re not questioning everything constantly, then chances are someone is choosing your life and your emotions for you.     You should always question yourself in life, love, career, relationships, family, and even what you are told by the people around you. Build awareness of self and intention. Why are you making the choices that you make? For you or someone else?       “Are you trying to ‘be right’ or ‘get it right’?”       A simple life gives you plenty of time for the important things.       No one cares what you think or do, it’s just your perspective on what they think of you.       The factors harming our attention are not all immediately obvious. I had been focused on tech at first, but in fact the causes range very widely – from the food we eat to the air we breathe, from the hours we work to the hours we no longer sleep.       You think you can achieve happiness by controlling the external circumstances and satisfying your desires?       An underrated aspect of success is becoming the sort of person that wants to improve.       You’ve been spoon-fed messages from society that tell you what you’re supposed to want, what’s supposed to make you happy, and how you’re supposed to live. This can cause you to feel like you’re ‘behind’ or ‘missing out’ if you don’t check all the boxes of conventional wisdom.     Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And once you accept that role you are doomed.       “Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.     …​ ​&gt;  But the most important thing to remember is not to worship yourself. Not as easy as it sounds.”     –David Foster Wallace       “The road to hell is not paved with good intentions. It is paved with lack of intention.” ​— Dr. Gabor Maté       Ignorance really is bliss when you’re self-aware enough to know your limitations.       Videos and television and movies are great fun. But don’t spend too much time on them. Leave lots of time for getting smarter by reading. Read widely. Read some books more than once. Write in your books. Don’t finish every book you start. You might be able to read 2500 books in your lifetime. Maybe a few more than that. It’s still a very small number. Choose wisely.      ","categories": ["statuses"],
