The former is about taking, whereas the latter is all about giving. One is short-lived and the other is long-lived. 

How many of us prioritise **happiness over pleasure**? When does the pleasure become indulgence? That last bag of Cheetos, one more episode in the NetFlix past midnight... Are those really helping us?

Please **don't confuse self-care with pleasure**. Self-care is a necessity whereas the pleasure is completely optional.

The things which build up over a long term which doesn't give instant joy mostly is related to happiness. For example, exercise, building skills can all bring happiness in the long run.

Is pleasure evil? **No**. It's the **imbalance which creates a real problem**.

Which one do we long for? Which one should we prioritise? How do we balance? The real battle is within.
