Leverage is something you can use to get maximum advantage of something. It is a tool. For you to use a tool, first you have to understand the fundamental principles about it.

In the age of the internet where every information ever created is accessible instantly with a few click, we have so much potential to create a greater good.

Just like any tool, things can be used in good and bad ways(even though the good and bad is just relative). You need to put in a lot of effort to master tools. 

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world." - Archimedes

What is the best tool to master? Mind? It is also the hardest to master. How much time and effort are you putting to master your mind? The first and greatest battle is always within.

How conscious are we in choosing our tools? How much mastery do you have over it? How are you planning to master new tools?
