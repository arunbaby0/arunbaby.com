Education is the industrial process of making people compliant. Command and control is the backbone of it. 
While learning is unleashing of a curious mind against the unknown. It is wandering through foreign territories. It can be guided or unguided.


The results that anyone wants to obtain through education is well defined. It can be a certificate or a degree. An external agency sets the limits for industrial education.
The learner sets the limit for the learning.  Learning must be an engaging journey.

If you want to learn how to bicycle, don't read a book, get on one and make mistakes. The fastest way to learn anything is by actively involving in an activity.

In the internet age, all you want to learn is a click away. Are we making use of all the resources that we have?

> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those **who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn**. -- Alvin Toffler

Please don't confuse education with learning.

How much are you learning? What all you want to discover? What stops you from acquiring that skill that you always wanted to master?
