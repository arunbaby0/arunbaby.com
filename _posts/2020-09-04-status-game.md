What if you could get rid of the idea that you always need to catch-up with your peers status wise? What changes will you make in your life? What stops you from doing that?

Will you hold on to your job/relationships/activities? Do you want that shiny new object? Is that object a necessity or just a show-off to others?


> Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. --- fight club

Are the things we think we want are the things that we genuinely want? Or, someone had programmed you into thinking that you want it.

What if you could relive yesterday? What changed would you make? What changes are you making for tomorrow?
