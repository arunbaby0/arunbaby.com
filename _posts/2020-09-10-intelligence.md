Are we intelligent? Will any intelligent person think themself of intelligent?

An intelligent person will be aware of the loopholes in their thinking. And someone who thinks of themselves as intelligent may be unaware of their state. 

>The measure of intelligence is the ability to change - Albert Einstein.

This quote goes per darwin's theory of evolution. The entire theory points out the importance of adaptability.

> Don't confuse education with intelligence - unknown

The compliance training(aka education) has nothing to do with intelligence. Also, the real learning doesn't have to be for any labels.

What if you stop trying to look intelligent and start trying to do something important? Isn't that a better way to learn? An intelligent way?
