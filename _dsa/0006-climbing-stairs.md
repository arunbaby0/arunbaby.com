**The Fibonacci problem in disguise, teaching the fundamental transition from recursion to dynamic programming to space optimization.**

## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb **1 or 2 steps**. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Two ways:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`

---

## Intuition

**Key Insight:** To reach step `n`, you must have come from either step `n-1` (then climb 1 step) or step `n-2` (then climb 2 steps).

**Recurrence relation:**
```
ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
```

This is the **Fibonacci sequence**!

**Why?**
- `ways(1) = 1` (one way: single step)
- `ways(2) = 2` (two ways: 1+1 or 2)
- `ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1) = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2) = 3 + 2 = 5`
- ...

---

## Approach 1: Recursion (Not Optimal)

Direct recursive implementation.

### Implementation

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Recursive solution
    
    Time: O(2^n) - exponential!
    Space: O(n) - recursion stack
    """
    # Base cases
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Recursive case
    return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2)

# Example
print(climbStairs(5))  # 8
```

**Why this is bad:**
```
climbStairs(5)
├── climbStairs(4)
│   ├── climbStairs(3)
│   │   ├── climbStairs(2) ✓
│   │   └── climbStairs(1) ✓
│   └── climbStairs(2) ✓ (recomputed!)
└── climbStairs(3) (entire subtree recomputed!)
    ├── climbStairs(2) ✓
    └── climbStairs(1) ✓

Massive redundant computation!
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n) - each call spawns two more calls  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - maximum recursion depth

---

## Approach 2: Recursion with Memoization

Cache results to avoid recomputation.

### Implementation

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Recursion with memoization (top-down DP)
    
    Time: O(n) - each subproblem solved once
    Space: O(n) - memoization cache + recursion stack
    """
    memo = {}
    
    def helper(n):
        # Base cases
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        
        # Check memo
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        
        # Compute and cache
        memo[n] = helper(n - 1) + helper(n - 2)
        return memo[n]
    
    return helper(n)

# Example
print(climbStairs(10))  # 89
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - each value computed once  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - memo dictionary + recursion stack

---

## Approach 3: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

Build solution iteratively from base cases.

### Implementation

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Bottom-up dynamic programming
    
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(n)
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # DP table
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    
    # Fill table
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    
    return dp[n]

# Example
print(climbStairs(5))  # 8
```

### Walkthrough

```
n = 5

Initial: dp = [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]
                0  1  2  3  4  5

i = 3:
  dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3
  dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0]

i = 4:
  dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 3 + 2 = 5
  dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0]

i = 5:
  dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 5 + 3 = 8
  dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Answer: dp[5] = 8
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## Approach 4: Space Optimized (Optimal)

Since we only need previous two values, use two variables.

### Implementation

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Space-optimized DP
    
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1) - only two variables!
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Only need previous two values
    prev2 = 1  # ways(1)
    prev1 = 2  # ways(2)
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    
    return prev1

# Example
print(climbStairs(10))  # 89
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - optimal!

---

## Approach 5: Fibonacci Formula (Constant Time)

Use Binet's formula for Fibonacci numbers.

### Implementation

```python
import math

def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Mathematical formula (Binet's formula)
    
    Time: O(1) - constant time!
    Space: O(1)
    
    Note: May have floating point precision issues for large n
    """
    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
    phi = (1 + sqrt5) / 2  # Golden ratio
    psi = (1 - sqrt5) / 2
    
    # Binet's formula (adjusted for stairs indexing)
    result = (phi ** (n + 1) - psi ** (n + 1)) / sqrt5
    
    return int(round(result))

# Example
print(climbStairs(10))  # 89
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - direct calculation  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Caveat:** Floating point arithmetic may cause precision issues for very large n.

---

## Approach 6: Matrix Exponentiation (Logarithmic Time)

For very large n, we can use matrix exponentiation to achieve O(log n) time.

### Mathematical Foundation

The Fibonacci recurrence can be expressed as matrix multiplication:

```
[F(n+1)]   [1  1]   [F(n)  ]
[F(n)  ] = [1  0] × [F(n-1)]
```

Therefore:

```
[F(n+1)]   [1  1]^n   [F(1)]
[F(n)  ] = [1  0]   × [F(0)]
```

We can compute the matrix power in O(log n) time using **exponentiation by squaring**.

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def climbStairsMatrix(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Matrix exponentiation approach
    
    Time: O(log n)
    Space: O(1)
    
    Best for very large n where even O(n) is too slow
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    def matrix_multiply(A, B):
        """Multiply two 2x2 matrices"""
        return [
            [A[0][0]*B[0][0] + A[0][1]*B[1][0], A[0][0]*B[0][1] + A[0][1]*B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0]*B[0][0] + A[1][1]*B[1][0], A[1][0]*B[0][1] + A[1][1]*B[1][1]]
        ]
    
    def matrix_power(M, n):
        """Compute M^n using exponentiation by squaring"""
        if n == 1:
            return M
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            half = matrix_power(M, n // 2)
            return matrix_multiply(half, half)
        else:
            return matrix_multiply(M, matrix_power(M, n - 1))
    
    # Base matrix
    base = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    
    # Compute base^n
    result = matrix_power(base, n)
    
    # Result is in result[0][0] (adjusted for our indexing)
    return result[0][0]

# Example
print(climbStairsMatrix(10))  # 89
print(climbStairsMatrix(50))  # 20365011074
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - halving problem size at each step  
**Space Complexity:** O(log n) - recursion stack (can be optimized to O(1) iteratively)

### When to Use Matrix Exponentiation

**Advantages:**
- Fastest asymptotic time complexity
- Works for extremely large n (where n iterations would be too slow)

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to implement
- Overkill for typical interview constraints (n ≤ 45)
- Risk of integer overflow for very large results

## Performance Comparison

Let's benchmark all approaches:

```python
import time

def climbStairsBottomUp(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

def climbStairsSpaceOptimized(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, prev1 + prev2
    return prev1

def benchmark(func, n, iterations=1000):
    """Benchmark function execution time"""
    start = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(iterations):
        func(n)
    end = time.perf_counter()
    return (end - start) / iterations * 1000  # ms

# Test different approaches
n = 30

approaches = {
    'Space Optimized O(n)': climbStairsSpaceOptimized,
    'Bottom-up O(n)': climbStairsBottomUp,
    'Matrix O(log n)': climbStairsMatrix,
    'Binet O(1)': climbStairs  # Using Binet's formula
}

print(f"Benchmarking for n={n} (1000 iterations each):\n")
for name, func in approaches.items():
    time_ms = benchmark(func, n)
    print(f"{name:30s}: {time_ms:.4f} ms")
```

**Key Insights:**

1. **For n ≤ 50:** Binet's formula or space-optimized DP is fastest
2. **For interviews:** Space-optimized DP is best (simple + optimal)
3. **For very large n:** Matrix exponentiation avoids iteration but has constant overhead
4. **Recursive with memo:** Never the best choice (overhead of recursion + dictionary lookups)

## Common Mistakes & Edge Cases

### Mistake 1: Off-by-One Errors

```python
# WRONG: Incorrect base case
def climbStairsWrong(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0  # Wrong! Should be 1 (one way to do nothing)
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # ...

# CORRECT
def climbStairsCorrect(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    # ...
```

### Mistake 2: Not Handling Edge Cases

```python
# WRONG: Doesn't handle n=0
def climbStairsWrong(n: int) -> int:
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):  # Breaks if n < 3
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
    return prev1

# CORRECT
def climbStairsCorrect(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n  # Handle small n explicitly
    
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
    return prev1
```

### Mistake 3: Integer Overflow

For very large n (e.g., n=100), the result exceeds typical integer limits in some languages.

```python
# Python handles big integers automatically
print(climbStairs(100))  # 573147844013817084101

# In Java/C++, you'd need BigInteger or modular arithmetic
# Often interview problems ask for result % MOD
def climbStairsMod(n: int, MOD: int = 10**9 + 7) -> int:
    """Return result modulo MOD to prevent overflow"""
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = (prev1 + prev2) % MOD
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
    
    return prev1

print(climbStairsMod(100))  # 687995182
```

### Mistake 4: Modifying Input in Memoization

```python
# WRONG: Global memo persists across test cases
memo = {}

def climbStairsWrong(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    memo[n] = climbStairsWrong(n-1) + climbStairsWrong(n-2)
    return memo[n]

# First call: correct
print(climbStairsWrong(5))  # 8

# Second call: uses stale memo
print(climbStairsWrong(3))  # 3, but used cached values from n=5 call

# CORRECT: Memo as local variable or function argument
def climbStairsCorrect(n: int) -> int:
    memo = {}  # Fresh memo for each call
    
    def helper(n):
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        memo[n] = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2)
        return memo[n]
    
    return helper(n)
```

### Edge Case: n = 0

```python
# Problem statement says 1 <= n <= 45, but defensive coding:
def climbStairsSafe(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # One way to not climb (stay at ground)
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
    
    return prev1
```

---

## Production Engineering Considerations

### 1. Caching for Repeated Queries

In a production system handling many queries:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class StairClimber:
    """
    Production-ready stair climbing calculator
    
    Use case: API endpoint that computes climbing ways for various n
    """
    
    @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
    def compute(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Compute with caching for repeated queries
        
        LRU cache stores recent results
        """
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        
        prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            current = prev1 + prev2
            prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
        
        return prev1
    
    def get_cache_info(self):
        """Get cache statistics"""
        return self.compute.cache_info()

# Usage
climber = StairClimber()

# First calls compute
print(climber.compute(10))  # Computes
print(climber.compute(10))  # Cache hit
print(climber.compute(15))  # Computes

print(climber.get_cache_info())
# CacheInfo(hits=1, misses=2, maxsize=128, currsize=2)
```

### 2. Precomputation for Low Latency

If you need ultra-low latency and n has known upper bound:

```python
class PrecomputedStairs:
    """
    Precompute all results up to MAX_N
    
    Use case: Latency-critical systems (e.g., real-time game logic)
    """
    
    MAX_N = 100
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Precompute all values at initialization"""
        self._precompute()
    
    def _precompute(self):
        """Compute all values from 1 to MAX_N"""
        self.cache = [0] * (self.MAX_N + 1)
        self.cache[1] = 1
        if self.MAX_N >= 2:
            self.cache[2] = 2
        
        for i in range(3, self.MAX_N + 1):
            self.cache[i] = self.cache[i-1] + self.cache[i-2]
    
    def compute(self, n: int) -> int:
        """O(1) lookup"""
        if n > self.MAX_N:
            raise ValueError(f"n must be <= {self.MAX_N}")
        return self.cache[n]

# Usage
stairs = PrecomputedStairs()  # Precompute on init

# All queries are O(1)
print(stairs.compute(50))  # Instant lookup
print(stairs.compute(100))  # Instant lookup
```

### 3. Handling Large-Scale Distributed Systems

```python
class DistributedStairComputer:
    """
    Handle climbing stairs in distributed system
    
    Use case: Distributed computing cluster
    """
    
    def compute_range(self, start: int, end: int) -> dict[int, int]:
        """
        Compute multiple values efficiently
        
        Instead of computing each independently, compute iteratively
        and return all values in range
        """
        if start < 1 or end < start:
            raise ValueError("Invalid range")
        
        results = {}
        
        # Bootstrap
        if start == 1:
            results[1] = 1
            prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
            current_n = 2
        elif start == 2:
            results[2] = 2
            prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
            current_n = 2
        else:
            # Compute up to start
            prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
            for i in range(3, start):
                current = prev1 + prev2
                prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
            current_n = start - 1
        
        # Compute range
        for n in range(max(start, current_n), end + 1):
            if n == 1:
                results[1] = 1
            elif n == 2:
                results[2] = 2
            else:
                current = prev1 + prev2
                results[n] = current
                prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
        
        return results

# Usage
computer = DistributedStairComputer()

# Compute batch of values (e.g., for multiple users)
batch_results = computer.compute_range(10, 20)
print(batch_results)
# {10: 89, 11: 144, 12: 233, ..., 20: 10946}
```

## Deep Dive: Why Dynamic Programming?

### The Optimal Substructure Property

**Definition:** A problem has *optimal substructure* if the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

**For climbing stairs:**
```
Optimal way to reach step n = 
    Optimal way to reach step (n-1) + take 1 step
    OR
    Optimal way to reach step (n-2) + take 2 steps
```

This property is **necessary** for DP to work.

### The Overlapping Subproblems Property

**Definition:** The problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused multiple times.

**For climbing stairs:**
```
climbStairs(5) needs:
  - climbStairs(4) and climbStairs(3)

climbStairs(4) needs:
  - climbStairs(3) and climbStairs(2)

Notice: climbStairs(3) is computed TWICE!
```

### Why Not Greedy?

**Greedy approach:** Always take the largest possible step (2 steps).

```python
def climbStairsGreedy(n: int) -> int:
    """
    WRONG: Greedy doesn't work here
    
    This would always take 2-steps when possible
    """
    ways = 0
    while n > 0:
        if n >= 2:
            n -= 2  # Take 2 steps
        else:
            n -= 1  # Take 1 step
        ways += 1
    return ways

print(climbStairsGreedy(5))  # Wrong answer!
```

**Why greedy fails:** We're counting *number of ways*, not finding *optimal path*. Greedy works for optimization problems with greedy choice property, not counting problems.

## Variations

### Variation 1: Can Climb 1, 2, or 3 Steps

```python
def climbStairsThreeSteps(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Can climb 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time
    
    Recurrence: ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2) + ways(n-3)

    if n <= 2:
        return n
    if n == 3:

    # Track previous three values
    prev3 = 1  # ways(1)
    prev2 = 2  # ways(2)
    prev1 = 4  # ways(3)

## Interview Tips

### Recognizing the Pattern

**When you see:**
- "Count number of ways"
- "Reach position n"
- "Each step has limited options"
- "Previous decisions affect current options"

**Think:** Dynamic Programming (likely Fibonacci-like)

### Interview Strategy: How to Approach This Problem

**Step 1: Clarify the Problem (1-2 minutes)**

Ask clarifying questions:
- "Can I confirm: we can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time?"
- "Are we counting distinct ways, not the minimum number of steps?"
- "Is n guaranteed to be positive?"
- "What's the maximum value of n I should handle?"

**Step 2: Walkthrough Examples (2-3 minutes)**

```
n = 1: [1] → 1 way
n = 2: [1,1], [2] → 2 ways
n = 3: [1,1,1], [1,2], [2,1] → 3 ways
n = 4: [1,1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,1,1], [2,2] → 5 ways

Pattern: Each n is sum of previous two → Fibonacci!
```

**Step 3: Propose Brute Force (1 minute)**

"The naive approach is recursion: to reach step n, we can come from n-1 or n-2. But this has exponential time complexity due to repeated subproblems."

**Step 4: Optimize with DP (3-5 minutes)**

"We can optimize using dynamic programming. Since we're recomputing the same subproblems, we can either:
1. Use memoization (top-down)
2. Use tabulation (bottom-up)

I'll go with bottom-up since it's simpler and avoids recursion overhead."

**Step 5: Further Optimize Space (1-2 minutes)**

"Since we only need the previous two values, we can optimize from O(n) space to O(1) using two variables."

**Step 6: Code + Test (5-7 minutes)**

Write the space-optimized solution and test with examples.

**Step 7: Discuss Edge Cases & Complexity (1-2 minutes)**

- Edge cases: n=1, n=2
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

**Total: ~15-20 minutes**

---

### Common Follow-ups

**Q1: What if we want to print all possible paths?**

```python
def climbStairsAllPaths(n: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Return all distinct paths to reach top
    
    Time: O(2^n) - exponential number of paths
    Space: O(2^n) - storing all paths
    """
    def backtrack(remaining, path, all_paths):
        if remaining == 0:
            all_paths.append(path[:])
            return
        
        if remaining < 0:
            return
        
        # Try 1 step
        path.append(1)
        backtrack(remaining - 1, path, all_paths)
        path.pop()
        
        # Try 2 steps
        path.append(2)
        backtrack(remaining - 2, path, all_paths)
        path.pop()
    
    all_paths = []
    backtrack(n, [], all_paths)
    return all_paths

# Example
paths = climbStairsAllPaths(4)
print(f"All paths to climb 4 stairs:")
for path in paths:
    print(path)
# Output:
# [1, 1, 1, 1]
# [1, 1, 2]
# [1, 2, 1]
# [2, 1, 1]
# [2, 2]
```

**Q2: What if steps have weights and we want minimum weight path?**

See "Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs" variation above.

**Q3: What's the space complexity of the recursive solution with memoization?**

O(n) for both memoization cache and recursion stack.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Fibonacci pattern** - Recognize when problem reduces to Fibonacci  
✅ **DP progression** - Recursion → Memoization → Bottom-up → Space-optimized  
✅ **Space optimization** - Only need last k values for k-way recurrence  
✅ **Counting problems** - DP naturally solves "count number of ways"  
✅ **Recurrence relations** - Key to DP is finding the recurrence  
✅ **ML applications** - Similar counting patterns in training strategies, feature selection  
✅ **Variations** - Variable step sizes, constraints, costs all use same DP template
